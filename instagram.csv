A West Indian Manatee calf nurses from its mom as they settle down on the sandy sea floor in the waters off the coast of Belize, an important country for these endangered animals. Manatees here live in mangroves and often sleep there overnight and feed on nearby sea grass beds during the day. Unlike Florida manatees, these animals are not nearly as acclimated to humans and are shyer. On this morning however, this very relaxed mom and calf allowed me into their world.

Historically these animals have thrived in this region, where come for a few weeks each year to engage in courtship, mating and pupping. But declining sea ice due to climate change over the last decade has caused problems for this species for without stable ice, the pups cannot suckle from their moms and may fall into the icy sea before they are physically prepared. Survival for this species is uncertain if these trends continue.

This area was inhabited for centuries by the San people; rock paintings can be found in caves and shelters across the reserve. An area of climatic extremes, with very cold winters; there is often snow on the mountains and temperatures fall well below zero, with summers that can be uncomfortably hot, with temperatures reaching mid 40 degrees Celsius and higher.
This mountain range is part of the Cape Fold mountain system and the geological formations are chiefly of the Table Mountain group - The reserve’s vegetation is remarkably diverse, featuring renosterveld, mountain fynbos, Karoo-veld, spekboom-veld, and numerous geophytes species.  Most plants flower in spring and some of the low lying areas are transformed into a wonderland as the first rains occur and the dormant plants display their true colours in vast abundance.
Mammals present here include klipspringer, grey rhebuck, kudu, baboon and dassie (rock hyrax). Leopard and caracal (lynx). More than one hundred and thirty bird species have been recorded here, notably black eagle, fish eagle, martial eagle, cape sugarbird and giant kingfisher - love this mountain range, it truly looks like its made from folded layers of marzipan 💚 follow me @chancellordavid to see more work and projects from here and elsewhere #swartbergmountains  #southafrica  #conserving  #wildlife """,https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/fda028ebd2242948a7f0679e4436506f/5C82DC41/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/40526107_755859061419783_5759795489624390062_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg2NTI4MjM0NjkyOTAwMjk3OA%3D%3D.2

450918,11586,"Photo by @stevewinterphoto | On October 29th, the government of China revealed that it will allow commercial trade in tiger bone and rhino horn from farmed animals for use in traditional Chinese medicine research and clinical treatments.
Debbie Banks, Environmental Investigation Agency UK, Tiger Campaign Director says: “At a single stroke, China has shattered its reputation as a growing leader in conservation following its domestic ban on the sale of ivory at the start of the year. It is instead revealed as a sham, its international image in tatters and its credibility destroyed—and all for the sake of deeply questionable business sectors which serve only to drive consumer demand for the parts and products of endangered species. History will not judge the Government of China kindly or with respect for such a reactionary, ill-judged and damaging decision.”
China’s action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on patients (though the market still existed for them).
This will further the trade in wild tigers, as the “wild tiger” will now be more valuable than farmed.

Territorially part of Yemen,  Socotra (Arabic: سُقُطْرَى‎ Suquṭra), is an archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea. The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 240km (150mi) east of the Horn of Africa and 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species – up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as ""the most alien-looking place on Earth”. In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 species found nowhere else on earth; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more impressive numbers.

Here is a mom and her cubs in the @africanparksnetwork @Zakouma_National_Park. Just 100 years ago there may have been as many as 500,000 lions which roamed the African continent but today there it is estimated that as few as 16,000 - 30,000 remain, and research by lion biologist Hans Bauer and colleagues suggests lions in much of west, east and central Africa will decline by 50% in the next two decades if something dramatic is not done! The biggest threats facing lions in Africa are poaching of their prey and retaliatory killings by farmers when lions eat their cattle! There is also an emerging threat of lions being used in Chinese medicine as tigers become rarer.  @wildaid ""When the buying stops the killing can too”

Poisonings and poaching are the main threats to lions across their East African range. Most lion populations in East, Central and West Africa are declining so the time to act is now. 
There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

After encircling her village, the Myanmar military started burning houses. They went house to house and shot the men, including Rohima’s husband. Five months pregnant and in shock, Rohima held her four-year-old to her chest, and her screaming six-year-old to her side. A soldier marched forward, picked up the distraught child, and threw him into the burning flames of a house. The screaming stopped. Somehow, through the tears and choking smoke, Rohima managed to slip away and into the jungle. Her four-year-old and unborn child were safe. But Rohima’s world was shattered. -
One of life’s greatest misconceptions is a simple fable. That time is a healer. One year ago this month “ethnic cleansing” perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya sparked a massive refugee crisis. Nearly a million Rohingya – those who escaped the flames and executions – are now living in camps in Bangladesh. Many of them were raped, most saw loved ones killed, thousands arrived wounded. All are traumatized. Here, in this impoverished monsoon soaked corner of Bangladesh, is one of the most densely populated areas of PTSD affected and depressed people on earth.

178187,712,"Photo by @stevewinterphoto | Rangers are often the first, and last line of defense not just in protecting the world’s wildlife, but in providing safety for millions of people around the world. Here in Zakouma National Park in Chad, after a devastating eight years where poaching reduced the elephant population from 4,000 to 400, the rangers are doing more than just holding the line. In 2010 in partnership with the Chadian Government, conservation organization African Parks @africanparksnetwork assumed management of the park  and overhauled law enforcement. It wasn’t for the faint of heart. Just a year after cracking down on poaching, six rangers were killed by poachers during their morning prayers before going out on patrol. But the rangers persevered and continued in their fight to protect the Park, its wildlife, and the surrounding communities. Eight years later, poaching has essentially become non-existent. Employment is on the rise, thousands of children are going to schools built by the park, and tourism is booming.
Rhinos were even reintroduced after a 50-year absence just in May, and elephants are on the rise for the first time in a decade. A record number of elephant calves were recently counted - showing new life and hope has been restored to Zakouma, thanks to the rangers.

Flying at sunrise, I had a goal of communicating the mystery and expanse of this under-appreciated habitat that is the fabric of the #FloridaWildlifeCorridor  in north Florida. Mature longleaf pines develop charismatic flat-top canopies after 150-or-so years when they start putting more energy into growing out than up. There are trees on Eglin that are 500-years-old, pre-dating when Columbus arrived in the New World. Once covering 90 million acres of the southeastern United States, only three million acres of longleaf remain. Conservation groups are working to restore longleaf from Florida to Georgia, Alabama and beyond. The region is an inspiration and potential proving grounds for E.O. Wilson’s “Half Earth” vision. Longleaf pine forests and savannas are among the most biologically diverse habitats on Earth.

As Americans celebrate the Labor Day holiday, please spare a thought for the more than 150 million children worldwide (UNICEF estimate) engaged in child labor. This little construction worker in the country of Benin works punishing hours on building sites, carrying loads far too heavy for his size, without pay. Thousands of children in West Africa end up in slavery in the abuse of an old tradition of sending village children to the cities to work in exchange for an education. Instead, they end up as unpaid workers in homes, factories and construction sites.
//
Child labor is defined as work carried out to the detriment and endangerment of a child, in violation of international law and national legislation. It either deprives children of schooling or requires them to assume the dual burden of schooling and work.
//
Child labor forbidden by law falls into three categories:
Slavery, trafficking, debt bondage and forced labor, forced recruitment for armed conflict, prostitution and pornography, and illicit activities; labor performed by a child under the minimum age for that work; and labor that jeopardizes the physical, mental or moral well-being of a child.

I was assigned by @natgeo to photograph the Dalits, also known as the Untouchables, those people who exist on the lowest rung of the India caste system.  This man has just emerged from cleaning out a sewer filled with filth by using only a bucket and a rope.  After finishing and closing the concrete cover, he had to go to several nearby homes before gaining permission to wash himself off with a garden hose.  Because he is an Untouchable he is destined to do what his father, his grandfather, and all the men in his family's past did, to clean waste from sewers.  There are Untouchables generations destined to a tradition of washing clothes, or tanning leather hides, or other tasks members of the upper castes refuse to do.  Despite his situation, this man who sits covered in sewage, wears a thin gold chain around his neck and I was struck by how it seemed to match the glint of pride in his eyes as I made his portrait.  He may be a collector of other people's wastes, but he does so with self esteem.

Once a breeding pair is established the eggs are cared for by both parents, who incubate the eggs in shifts of 5–10 days for the following five weeks.

On this night, Luke's girlfriend Rachel joins for the ride. This is the final image in a photo story I produced during the Missouri Photo Workshop. I applied wanting to reconnect with the fundamentals of photojournalism and push to develop a picture story around the lives of people I had never met in a place I didn’t know. After two years of chasing Florida panthers with camera traps nearly full time, it had become common for weeks to go by without holding a camera in my hands. So I set the high-tech equipment aside and went to Missouri with just one camera for an immersive experience that involved a lot of looking, listening and waiting. Each student was limited to just 400 photos for the week, with no deletions. When I am on assignment, I often shoot 1000 photos in a day. But the workshop leaders encouraged us to trust the process and to be intentional about the moments we tried to capture. By watching and waiting we would know when a moment was building and we should trust ourselves respond. By Wednesday evening I had watched the Fry brothers drive the tractor two previous times. But when I saw this sunset forming and heard the tractor coming on the third night, I started running down the hill, remembering the floodlights on the cab that could balance exposure with the western sky. Had I not been watching the farm work for two days, I wouldn’t have reacted when this moment presented itself.

The bond between moms and calves is strong, with calves spending their first year with their mothers, during which time they nurse and are given protection. Although much has been learned about this species throughout decades of research, much remains to be learned about the culture of these complex societies in the sea.

Immigration is often propelled by suffering. To witness the shifting patterns of populations is to see the world in all its exigencies—war, natural disasters, repression, famine, poverty and persecution.
But there is a rainbow at the bottom of that Pandora’s box of troubles; hope, too, propels immigrants to settle in strange lands. I should know: I am one myself. 
I have followed and photographed twenty families in Chinatown, and those relationships are now culminating in a tri-generational drama. The people in these pictures were all willing to sacrifice their immediate comfort to realize the dream of giving their children a ""better"" life. Some of that first wave of immigrants have now returned to China to enjoy the rest of their lives in prosperity, with family members they have not seen for decades. Others are trying to live the American dream.

This species of bird is seasonally monogamous and their breeding season can last almost two years from the start until the end of caring for the chicks. The Phoenix Islands are owned by the country of Kiribati and were protected as a massive marine protected area several years ago. Since the marine ecosystems are healthy, sea birds can forage close to the islands rather than having to journey far for food for themselves and their chicks.  Fledging occurs after four to six months and is typically determined by food abundance.

Baby humpback whales are very light in colour, almost white. Within days soft scratches on their skin become visible. These scratches are caused by mum and the baby affectionately rubbing against each other which strengthens their unique bond. I like to think that the more scratches they have, the more loved they are.

My assignment to photograph Peru as a country story for @natgeo magazine had an incredible impact on my life both professionally and personally. I was coming out of a period where Id concentrated on the American West; about a 13 year love affair with the West. I realized I had to go to a different well if my work was going to grow; I had to find a different palette, a different culture. I heard through the grapevine that the magazine was going to do a story about Peru and I somehow felt an absolute need to get the assignment to do the photography. Here, in this image, done within just a few days of my arrival in Peru, I was in a small Andean village where six people had been killed by an earthquake. The Peruvian government had sent a helicopter with a medical team and a priest to the village and these young girls are peering, open mouthed, and awestruck. They had never seen a doctor before. While working in Peru I met and fell in love with a woman who several years later would become my wife. She was walking through the Plaza des Armas in Ayacucho during Easter week in 1981. I followed her around the Plaza for a while before building the courage to ask if she spoke English which she firmly answered, """"No"""". And that was that until another day not much later when I was able to engage her in an invitation to join my group to attend a cultural event one night, and with that evening the beginning of our romance took flame. And it still burns 37 years and counting.

Zakouma is just one of 15 parks managed by conservation NGO African Parks (@africanparksnetwork). If you want to see wild plains teeming with lions, leopards, herds of elephants, giraffe, and now rhinos (they just reintroduced black rhinos after a 50-year absence) and no tourists - go to Zakouma - check out the lodges there and in the other parks the manage in 8 other countries via their website. Tourism revenue goes back to the parks they manage and important community projects like education, healthcare and improved livelihoods.
What is happening in Zakouma is one of the most hopeful stories in conservation. The park was once ravaged by poaching and insecurity. More than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory – and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. By 2010, only 450 elephants remained. That same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of Chad to fully manage Zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016.  Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

The cave of Altamira was reported in 1880 by Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. It was the first paleolithic art cave to be identified. The cave was first greeted with amazement but the discovery soon deteriorated into deep controversy that followed Marcelino Sanz de Salutoula to his grave. In the 1880s it was thought that prehistoric humans lacked the capacity for abstract thought. Paintings like this could not have possibly been made by Ice Age people. It was not until other paleolithic art caves were discovered in France that Altamira was accepted as genuine. 
Archaeological deposits in the cave place human occupation between the Upper Solutrean and Lower Magdalenian eras (18,500-14,000 BCE). Uranium/Thorium dating of calcite deposits on top of some of the artworks place the works within the Aurignacian and Solutrean periods (36,000-22,000 BCE). This U-T dating suggests that Altamira was painted over a period of more than 10,000 years.

Bhante Heenbunne Kondanna: “I live in a temple on Staten Island. We have a big Sri Lankan community there so most of them are Buddhist. Very basically, Buddhism, if I explain it, is not to do evil. Do good, purify your mind. Not to do anything wrong, which is hard. So you need a definition for that. Whatever’s harmful to you and to the other person is not good. Whatever is beneficial to you and to the other person is good. Either good or bad go into the category of Karma. So you stay on the good side, the positive side. How do you do that? 
By practicing meditation, refining your mind. You know, our minds, we have so much luggage in there. Be aware of it. 'I can show you the path but you have to walk the path', that’s what the Buddha said. When you practice meditation, you can see yourself.

Greed, hatred and ignorance are the three root causes of all these crazy things that we do. Free yourself, find your own peace. That’s the central message that Buddha gave. There are a lot of things that we are doing habitually and so what he was encouraging is don’t live habitually, live mindfully. When you are mindfully living, you are concentrated about other people. Life is like a bubble of water…like a dew drop which is hanging on the tip of a leaf. Any time it’s fragile, any time it can drop off. So therefore, uncertainty is always there so don’t leave any room for regret, do nice things. Do things that you can be happy [about] so that you are always prepared. What Buddha said was ‘may all beings be well and happy.’ That’s all. You can practice it. Practice it like a mother who has only one child. She will be risking her life to save her only child. So we must have that quality within us. Use that same kind of love to all beings.”",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4c06b9a64be57b4b0fcf3db8882c03ca/5C6B6220/t51.2885-15/e35/37934585_2063337193995907_4622034656227753984_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg1MDQwNDgwOTkwNDgxNTE1NQ%3D%3D.2

This animal behavior is so similar in many ways to us as humans! Our animal family is so much like us - they find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families. If we can find a way to believe they think, feel and have emotions, we need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not.

Jaguars are the 3rd largest of the big cats. Found from US / Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in this area where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguars range.

It’s a rare and peaceful slice of a troubled country, but when a family from Kabul calls with a request, the echoes of war eclipse the cloudless September sky. They’re afraid to attend a wedding after a spate of suicide bombings in the capital—can Ramazan see their fate? He clutches his prayer beads and squeezes his eyes shut. This year marked a record high for civilian deaths in Afghanistan. Here, daily life is plagued by an insidious violence—unpredictable, indiscriminate, irrevocable. An explosion at the airport. Suicide bombing at the gym. A high school. A shopping center. A wedding. Safe spaces shrink into oblivion; the future cleaves to shreds; the only certainty is this moment.

The portrait of the fragile but seemingly unafraid little girl seen alongside the heads of two enormous draft horses was published in the August, 1964 issue of National Geographic in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  The child was with her father who was working in his fields.  At some point in the afternoon she was standing in the back of a farm wagon, the horses, unhitched, were about to be led to the barn and for a moment they provided the background for her profile.  Her blouse appears worn, perhaps a bit dirty from childish play, and its pale blue color seems to echo the softness in the child's light complexion and wispy, blond hair.  Photographing the Amish was the beginning of my photographic depiction of several subcultures in my country and elsewhere during the 1960's.  My essays on the Amish in 1964, the Basques of France and Spain in 1968, and the Hutterites of Montana in 1969, all dealt with the lives of people living in a culture of their own.

This is probably a good thing, because wild lesser flamingos have specialized diets of blue-green algae and diatoms. Their diet restricts their habitats to hyper-alkaline and soda lakes and is also the reason for their pink coloring! The pigment of their feathers, legs, and face all come from the organisms they eat. As the blue-green algae they consume is digested, the pigments dissolve in fats and is transferred into the feathers, through this process the color becomes pink. Variations in their coloring can happen based on the volume they ingest. They are classified as near threatened by IUCN; and their main threats are decreasing breeding success, predation, human development, and pollution from to the soda lakes the birds rely on. #flamingos  #PhotoArk",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/76b5527f476ed83846006ef4d278941c/5C8EE70F/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/39894870_1940693929556660_5354759597892402333_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg3MTAzNTI3NTQ2OTA3ODg1MA%3D%3D.2

When you look up the Greek roots of the world “photography” its meaning translates close to “painting with light”.

My work for National Geographic Magazine often means I get to spend a little more time than most with incredible #animals . Occasionally that results in magic moments like this where I am able to be meters away from giant #silverbacks  who are as curious about me as I am about them. I got to make this image while shooting an essay for National Geographic on this amazing park and the difficulties of conserving nature here.There are only around 40-50 of these alpha males in the world. I saw these 2 silverbacks from the Mpua family in the Jomba rainforest of Virunga, it's very unusual to see them hanging out together like this, usually they are pitted against each other for leadership. Virunga is a tough place for conservation, recently a female ranger was killed and the park shut down tourism for a while. They are gearing up to open again and if you have the chance, I would encourage you to go and see these magnificent animals in the flesh. There is nothing like locking eyes with one of these Silverbacks and feeling what can only be described as a human connection. Frankly, the first time it happened to me, it changed my whole career path and my thinking about the world I was covering. I think Virunga is the best place in the world for this experience, the most authentic way to spend time with these incredible animals. It doesn't hurt that its also the cheapest and that you are helping support #conservationists  who need it most.",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e36f25f41a06bcfdd9eec534e0f6b329/5C786606/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/41615530_296829930908777_1415513258455916960_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg3ODM0Mzk5NTU0NTkyNTY1MA%3D%3D.2

His eye was shot out by a logger when Jorge and his dad tried to raid a logging camp for machetes and other items in the mid 1990’s. They escaped, but soon after were hunted down by the loggers aided by guides from another indigenous tribe. Approximately 15 Chitonahua were captured and forced to leave the forest interior and relocate to a village on the Yurua River where they live today. Despite being contacted over 20 years ago, the Chitonahua still struggle to assimilate into modern society. This includes earning money to purchase salt, medicine, clothing and other items they now depend on. However, compared to many other tribes in initial contact in Peru, the Chitonahua are doing relatively well. They have an impressive garden of vegetables, fruit trees and medicinal plants and recently won a government sponsored competition among local villages for raising domesticated animals.

590079,1951,"Image by @beverlyjoubert. Up close to the dominant male of the infamous, buffalo-hunting Tsaro Pride in Duba Plains in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Recently the pride has largely changed their go-to prey to the thriving population of red lechwe. The numbers of these swamp-living antelope have increased enormously in the last decade since hunting ended here. It's good news for these big cats because the buffalo move seasonally (and are a much more dangerous prey). But the smaller size of these antelope means that the lions need to hunt more often. This is a good time of year for the pride to hunt lechwe. The males are fighting and the sharp clash of horns alerts the cats to the location of those individuals who are preoccupied and not on the lookout for predators. Dominant male lions (being male lions), will take advantage of the lionesses kills where possible rather than expend their energy hunting for themselves. How do they know when a kill happens? Often it is by following vultures - whose sudden flocks are quick giveaway of a possible meal. Here the male watches vultures fly overhead before deciding whether or not to follow them. #Thisismytrophy  #bigcats  #okavangolions  #lion  #causeanuproar  #TsaroPride  #DubaPlains",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ef09f8809680882a4a0747d682c5b862/5C7EA464/t51.2885-15/e15/40084024_503343493470407_7700745159067041792_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg1NjYzMDQ4Mjc5MjM2Njc1MA%3D%3D.2

Though the dream of driving cross country has yet to come true, I drove on Route 66 in California and spent a couple of nights in the teepee themed Wigwam Motel in San Bernadino, CA. In an evening of February, those teepees looked like a movie set from Hollywood. At the motel, I was welcomed by the owners, an Indian couple from Gujarat, with a cup of masala milk tea and some Indian snacks. The next morning, I met six English men who were driving their motorbikes cross country and also staying in the motel. It was wacky experience for me to be at a Native American teepee themed motel, owned by Indians with visitors from England on my first visit to Route 66.

480644,1094,"Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio | Territorially part of Yemen,  Socotra (Arabic: سُقُطْرَى‎ Suquṭra), is an archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as ""the most alien-looking place on Earth”. The Dragon Blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) has a unique and strange appearance, with an ""upturned, densely packed crown"". This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as ""dragon's blood"". The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock. One of the species' greatest threats is the gradual dessication of the archipelago.

Coming from ponies taken to Iceland by Norse settlers in the 9th and 10th centuries, the Icelandic horse is mentioned in literature and historical records throughout Icelandic history. Centuries of selective breeding developed the breed into its current form. The equine ancestors of the breed were likely brought to the island by Viking Age Scandinavians between 860 and 935 AD. The earliest Norse people venerated the horse as a symbol of fertility, with white horses holding a particularly special place in belief, often being offered as sacrifice at certain feasts and ceremonies.

Karymsky (Russian: Карымская) is a stratovolcano and lake on the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, here photographed in winter, with the crater lake beyond. Karymsky is the most active volcano in the region and has been erupting continuously since a powerful earthquake struck the region in January 1996. The initial eruptions projected an estimated 30-40 million tons of pyroclastic material, saturated with acidic fluids, into the air, turning the nearby freshwater lake into a toxic chemical soup and decimating its ecosystem. Scientists are monitoring the volcano closely and despite the ecological catastrophe, Karymsky Lake is slowly recovering to pre-1996 conditions.

565140,4487,"Photo by @jasperdoest | A Galápagos giant tortoise after eating an invasive species of guava fruit on Santa Cruz Island #Galápagos . 
While invasive species are usually not good news,  scientist think that the invasive fruit may be a boost for an aptly named subspecies called the indefatigable island tortoise (Chelonoidis porteri), which is considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 
It's easy to see why tortoises would prefer some invasive species over native ones. The native species of guava, (Psidium galapageium), tends to produce small fruit that has thick skin, large seeds, and bitter pulp. On the other hand, the invasive species of guava, (P. guajava), has been cultivated around the world. As a result, the tree produces dense clusters of large, juicy, thin-skinned fruits that the tortoises love to eat. And furthermore it’s also a matter of availability. 
Because tortoises distribute seeds through their dung, the animals contribute to the increase of invasive guava on the islands. While a forest full of invasive plants may be good for the Galápagos tortoise in the short-term, the effects these species have on the ecosystem at large is still a mystery.

In my series ‘Toy Stories’, I explore the connection between children and their toys and I try to give an insight into their tiny worlds and takes you on a trip down memory lane.
‘Toy Stories’ is the result of an 24 month round the world trip where I visited a variety of countries and cultures and took photographs of children and their toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph.
Despite some differences, I found similarities between children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys played the same function, or example protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. - Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid.

While preparing for the assignment in D.C. at the Geographic headquarters, I asked to be able to do it by motorcycle which the magazine's top editor granted me.

Traveling that way did give me a closer feeling to the land and my experience of meeting people along the way. And yes, I still have the bike.

Tiger sharks are an apex predator species in tropical waters though much of their lives have remained a mystery until recently. Researchers are now learning about behaviors and migratory patterns that are beginning to fill in the puzzle of their life cycle. Despite being large predators, life in the ocean is difficult and they face many challenges to survive. And as with all species, the tiger shark faces declining populations worldwide as the demand for shark fins continues. Having photographed sharks in locations worldwide, it is quite common these days to see sharks with hooks.

“All my community was destroyed” said Adham Lambo, a Syrian refugee currently living in the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. Moria camp overflows with refugees and their desperation. Inhuman living conditions and a snail-paced relocation process can drive the already traumatized towards depression and suicide - mental health issues that haunt a people with no home. They thought they had escaped the trauma of war & would find peace in Europe, however the camp become their new source of trauma. Lambo lives in fear of the violence and stress which plague life in the camp. “I spend all my time outside the camp. I go to the sea at 11am and come back 10 at night.”

Smoke was rising from the earth and the ground was still hot to the touch. There was no color, just black and grey. The scene suggested the snake had slithered as fast as possible to make it to the river, but that the burns to over half its body overwhelmed it, and the beautiful creature died just a few feet from safety. The sadness amongst us was such that one could feel it in the air. The hardest part wasn’t that they died but how they died.

Religion: Nuyagi Keetoowah Society
Ray Evans Harrell: I grew up in the O-Gah-Pah Nation in the current state of Oklahoma.  Indian religions were banned in 1883, so I grew up in the Indian Baptist community of Picher, Oklahoma, directed music in churches and ended up studying in New York.  In 1978 President Jimmy Carter signed the Freedom of Religion Act for American Indians and so for the first time we were able to ""come out"", so to speak. We started having prayer circles on a roof down on White street in Manhattan.

I became the apprentice to a Cherokee Medicine Priest and am now the Priest for the Nuyagi Keetoowah Society. Our job is to uphold and bring back the knowledge of our culture. We obviously are not farmers and hunters, we are urban people, I am an opera singer, we're developing something in the present to live in this tradition.

Our worship is meant to acquaint you with how to sense the environment in non-visual ways because one is  really tied to whether something exists, by whether they can see it. Our religion is holistic in that it involves all seven senses. 
We meet at a Stomp ground and light three fires. We build a cornmeal circle and there are seven directions that we include because they represent the front, the back, the left, the right, the up, the down, the center. And then the eighth direction is to the universe. We call it a Medicine Wheel.

It symbolizes that individually we are inadequate, we are limited. But when we put the circle together we can conceive of the whole of the reality, discover a greater truth for ourselves. 
Our message is that you are responsible for yourself and nobody escapes responsibility for what they do. The world is your teacher and you are to understand that you are a part of the Creator. 
Everything is a part of everything.

After spending most of a hot Wednesday afternoon with reporter @jillfilipovic recounting some of the most intimate details of the worst days of her life, Silvana retreated to her grandson’s bedroom. Finally speaking the truth about what happened, Silvana said, feels good, even powerful – like a layer of shame peeled back with each telling. But each telling also means exposing painful scars, literal and metaphorical. I photographed Silvana at that axis of strength and depletion, as she sought out the grounding weight of her grandson’s small body, and offered him the soft foundation of her own. These are questions everywhere: whose stories we choose to believe, what weight we give a woman’s words against a man’s, whether women have exclusive jurisdiction over our own bodies. It is simultaneously dignifying and terrifying for women to tell the secrets more-powerful men demand we keep, and it’s never felt so important to listen, to believe, and to acknowledge the personal courage and integrity of the women who share their stories with us. “I feel light,” Silvana said after our interview ended. “Like I was carrying something really heavy and I put it down.” #believewomen  #women  #sexualassault  #colombia",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5542d6654b54a5c75c41ab1410e86b3c/5C8BB9E6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s750x750/42966925_600029153747392_8448606064158632762_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg4Njc1NDE1NzY3OTkzMjAwMg%3D%3D.2

The Highlands-Glades Bear Project was a collaboration between University of Kentucky and @ArchboldStation. Joe’s professor David Maehr, who was lost in a plane crash tracking a missing black bear with rancher Mason Smoak, often made the point that there would be no bears in that part of Florida without the proactive stewardship of ranchers. GPS tracking showed that bears traveled as far as 500 miles across a patchwork or ranches, groves and public preserves that keep the Northern Everglades connected for wide ranging wildlife. Through research, bears have shown us what we need to do to save the Corridor, and in that way are preparing the path of recovery for the Florida panther as it reclaims historic territory northwards out of the Everglades. #PathofthePanther  @FL_WildCorridor #floridawild  #keepflwild #bear  #forest  #conservation  #florida #wildlife  @myfwc @natgeo @insidenatgeo",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0075a17fe42c9e4a2f51c36c1f06bb52/5C78BFBA/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/38812831_529618927469080_7559672036197400576_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg0ODc0ODU1MjMxOTI1NzYzOQ%3D%3D.2

He has never been able to afford his own flock, and is constantly on the move—a reason, he says, that women have always left him. In Transylvania and other remote areas of Romania, many people farm on a small scale, in ways unchanged for centuries. Their farms have among the lowest yields in Europe, but also some of the highest levels of self-sufficiency. Lack of money and suspicion of unfamiliar methods mean that few chemicals and artificial fertilizers are used. But in the past decade, many have abandoned their farms for at least part of the year to work in cities abroad. Romania’s 2007 entry into the European Union also threatened this traditional way of life, as farmers cannot compete with European imports, and the small size of farms means they are not eligible for EU subsidies.

After a quarantine period, she was combined with the other fox kits in care to form an adopted litter-- which helps youngsters learn the social and hunting skills they need to survive in the wild after their release. Red foxes are born almost completely black and are therefore often mistaken for domestic puppies, raccoons, or even skunks! This species has a keen sense of vision, smell, and hearing. Their vertical pupils help them see well in the dark (like a cat) and it's said that they can hear prey moving under the snow up to 40 yards away! Red foxes are found throughout the United States and populations are considered stable, with a listing of least concern on the IUCN Red List. They adapt readily to green spaces in cities, particularly in large parks, on golf courses, and highways where they provide a valuable service to their human neighbors-- rodent control.  Although this species has a stable population, other fox species are at risk due to human encroachment on territory and human-introduced diseases such as canine distemper.

Red lechwe numbers have increased tenfold in the decade since hunting stopped at Duba Plains and as a result the area is able to sustain more predators. This pride currently has six young cubs and when they're not clamoring for food, they're looking for attention and someone to play with. Half a dozen young cubs can be very hard work but the Skimmer male has consistently shown great patience with his young offspring - although they will quickly learn just how far they can push him! Judging by this photo, the cubs are rapidly learning not only discipline from their impressive father, but the proud stance and focused stare of an apex predator as well. #ThisIsMyTrophy  #SkimmerPride  #OkavangoLions  #BigCats",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e169efbeba549a8bf5b05d7e3c71e233/5C742C81/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/40735983_339511216791175_7341507438226323464_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg2NTY1OTg2Njg4NzgzMjI0NQ%3D%3D.2

This is seen in a number of mammals and most cats (including house cats), and allows them to check the reproductive or territorial status of others. Both males and females will bare their teeth like this when they come across a scent that gives them a chemical signal. This dominant male is testing the pheromones in the urine of a female who is coming into estrus and, after sensing her readiness, will track her very closely.

As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as """"the most alien-looking place on Earth”. In the Dragon's Blood tree Forest at Diksam. An hour long exposure. The Dragon Blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) has a unique and strange appearance, with an """"upturned, densely packed crown"""". This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as """"dragon's blood"""". The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock. One of the species' greatest threats is the gradual dessication of the archipelago.

Many people envision working in the studio as a high-energy, creative experience with me shouting “beautiful baby, beautiful” and the dogs responding with pose after pose like models before the lens of the famous fashion photographer and international spy, Austin Powers.

The reality is, I’m somewhat unable to speak when making photographs. It’s a genetic flaw or some right brain/left brain quirk realized when I was rejected from my childhood garage band for not being able to sing and play drums at the same time. Damn you Phil Collins.

When we work, this leaves me with a limited menu of grunting noises and the occasional guttural outburst, which I still find helpful in getting an animals attention. It also passes for a kind of barbaric shorthand between my wife Callie and I, until she tires of it and gets mad at me, which she finds helpful in getting my attention.

Zorro is a 12 year-old Standard Poodle, too smart to get in the middle of our bickering. He tried to stay neutral but always sided with Callie. This is often the case with the nice lady holding food and I learn to live with rejection.

This is more frustrating because Zorro is a very special dog that lights up a room when he enters and I want a dog like that to like me.

More caregiver than therapy dog, Zorro has always been there for the people who needed him most, some at the end of their lives and some who would miss those people the most.

Our connection was fleeting and dramatic and came together when I was finally able to vocalize a sound that engaged Zorro. 
I was trying to say his name but it came out with a poor rationing of consonants to vowels; 
Shtwa -thwo-or-oht-za-moAlshs

This stopped Zorro, deeply engaged with Callie and a snack of some kind, He turned to me, tilted his head and then he gave me -The Eyes; the eyes that had comforted, the eyes that had gotten him out of trouble, the eyes that had earned him more than his fair share of mac and cheese.

And then, Zorro burped.

Beautiful baby, beautiful.

I’m posting her photograph to remember her and other young Haitian girls today on the International #DayoftheGirl . She was a student in a small local school. She told me she loved to read and that one day she hoped to be a nurse. I never saw her again after that visit but I think of her quite often because she so embodied the spirit and talent and the hopes and sense of possibility that all Haitians share and that is shared by young girls around the world.  I hope she accomplished her dreams. Like many developing nations, the literacy rate in Haiti is low and below the average for Latin American and Caribbean countries. Haiti faces shortages in educational supplies and qualified teachers where the rural population is less educated than the urban. A major earthquake in 2010 exacerbated an already difficult system by destroying infrastructure and displacing 50 to 90% of of students. Private education, which must be paid for, has substituted for education in public schools although the government has attempted initiatives to change this.  I tried very hard to help educate children in Haiti but the need was like a bottomless pit. In the world young women 15-29 are more than 3 times as likely as young men to not be in employment, education or training, according to UNICEF. Education can help change stereotypes we have held onto too long and take advantage of the talent and creative voices of girls to make a more vibrant and equitable world.  There are many organisations, ranging from public to private, that support and promote the education of girls around the world.  If you want to make the world a better place and safer for young women, please consider researching and supporting the education of girls and give them a voice.

A variety of leaves, seeds, bugs, bird eggs and even the chest bone from a chicken collected from the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma, a personal project that I began a couple of years ago to deal with a buildup of having witnessed a mixture of both the worst and the best of humankind. Many photographers have personal projects and it is these in which instead of telling the stories of others, we tell our own stories in whatever form we please. This is what the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma is for me. In my career I have covered everything from war to fashion and seen great suffering and violence. I have told stories about heroic figures and those who were beaten down by life. We photographers choose to be in places where we see suffering and glory and to bear witness. But these things impact us in unexpected ways including a kind of longing for normality or loneliness or missing home or feeling completely disconnected from the world. We don’t realize the toll it takes on us until we are forced to face it. In the past two years alongside regular assignments, sometimes challenging ones, I decided I needed to play, to plant the seeds of new ideas, to be wild at heart without having to make excuses or explain myself, to tell my own story or a part of it. I created The Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma. Lily is my alter ego in an alternate universe. She is everything I am not….or maybe she is everything I am.

The era in your life when the only thing you knew about a bill was that it was a bird’s equivalent of lips and your day job was to construct fantastical worlds with your favorite toys. In my series ‘Toy Stories’, I explore the connection between children and their toys and I try to give an insight into their tiny worlds and takes you on a trip down memory lane. ‘Toy Stories’ is the result of an 30 month round the world trip where I visited more then 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities between children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys played the same function, or example protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. - Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid.

Koryaksky volcano, Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. In 1996, as part of the United Nations' International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, Koryaksky volcano in Russia's far east was designated a “Decade Volcano”, worthy of particular study in light of its history of explosive eruptions and proximity to populated areas. Ten years ago, in 2008, Koryaksky erupted with a 6,000m (20,000ft) plume of ash, the first major eruption in 3,500 years.

They have an incredible tolerance for cold, high altitude or drought - they can go without water for months at a time, and then drink up to 57 liters at once. Bactrian camels belong to a fairly small group of animals that regularly eat snow to provide their water needs.

It is the longest bridge on the Zayanderud, with a total length of almost 300m (977ft), and is one of the most famous examples of Safavid bridge design. Isfahan was once one of the largest cities in the world, flourishing from 1050 to 1722, particularly in the 16th & 17th centuries during the Safavid dynasty, when it became the capital of Persia for the second time in its history. Even today, the city retains much of its past glory. It is famous for its Persian–Islamic architecture, with many beautiful palaces, boulevards, mosques, minarets and bridges. This led to the Persian proverb “Esfahān nesf-e- jahān ast"""" (Isfahan is half of the world). The Zayandeh River used to have significant flow throughout the year, unlike many of Iran's rivers which are seasonal, but today runs dry due to water extraction before reaching Isfahan. In the early 2010s, the lower reaches of the river dried out completely after successive dry-outs.

Eric, an 8 year old eastern black rhino is translocated 10,000 miles, across 5 countries over 68 hours, from the San Diego Safari Park @sdzsafaripark in California to the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania. He is part of a project to increase the population of critically endangered black rhino within the greater Serengeti ecosystem. There are less than 750 Eastern Black Rhinos left in the wild. Eric was moved because his genetics are overrepresented in captive rhinos in the US but will be an important boost to the existing rhinos in the Serengeti ecosystem and east Africa 
The project is run by the Singita Grumeti Fund @grumetifund, a non-profit in the western Serengeti, which is working with the Tanzanian government to conserve wildlife and to boost the local population of black rhino in their native habitat. Eric joins a female eastern black rhino already living at Singita Grumeti. Their introduction to each other and hopeful breeding success forms the first phase of this exciting new black rhino expansion project.

Now, the 57-year-old farmer carries on his cause to stop extraction companies from encroaching on their land. “The only thing we’re asking for is respect and our right to make our own decisions,” she says.

For nearly five decades, the Philippine government has been engaged in armed conflicts in the southern region of Mindanao. The prolonged conflicts, rooted deeply in disputes over land, political and religious ideology, have resulted in thousands of people being killed, with many more enduring repeated displacement and hardship. //
Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. Women are hardly passive victims though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. //

Narwhals are called the ‘unicorn whale’ due to their tusk, which is actually a canine tooth that protrudes from the animal’s lip. Male narwhal tusks can grow to lengths of nearly nine feet. I made this photo from a helicopter using a telephoto lens. We were flying at around midnight during the summer in the arctic where daylight is continuous. I spied these whales as they surfaced for a breath in the cold ocean and hoped they would linger a bit so that I could observe them longer. The sense of wildness before my eyes was extraordinary and I felt blessed to be in this specific place at this moment in time. 
This region is changing rapidly however, as warming climate is effecting wildlife and indigenous cultures. In the not too distant future, I believe this place will look very different.

We have access to information and many of us are fortunate enough to be able to make choices which allow us to move through this world in a more conscious way.

The ocean is everyone's blue backyard - so where ever we are in the world we are able to contribute to the health of this incredible ecosystem - whether its through waste reduction, conscious food choices or supporting marine parks which are absolutely vital for allowing fish stocks to replenish - main food source for creatures such as the Australian Sea Lion.

Lens-like, it pulls in in Muslims from Salah e-Din Street, Orthodox Jews from Mea She'arim, Christian pilgrims from the hostels on the old Green Line and even the odd National Geographic photographer and squeezes them through this narrow gap in Suleiman the Magnificent's walls. It's like one of those technical drawings of how a jet engine works: it intakes these believers, fires them through grand architecture and ejects them at high energy through the nozzle of El Wad St and down into the Old City and its holy sites. Except instead of thrust it's an engine for producing piety. I think it is the most exciting, jinking left-turn right-turn in History.
I'm rooming on the Via Dolorosa and I have my morning coffee to the sound of pilgrims from Romania or Nigeria or Korea, below my window, singing mournfully at the 8th Station of the Cross.

278539,445,"Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | A gamekeepers apprentice extinguishing a patchwork of burning heather late into the evening, on Invermark, Cairngorm National Park, Scotland - Back in the Cairngorm National Park, Scotland for the muir burn - documenting a gamekeepers life - in this extraordinary landscape fire is still a commonly used and controversial agricultural tool, with farmers, crofters and gamekeepers burning grass, heather and gorse. In Scotland the season runs from 01 October through 15 April each year. Much of the heather burning we see today takes place on grouse moors such as those here in the Cairngorm National Park, Scotland. Here for generations gamekeepers have burnt long narrow strips of mature heather on a rotation. How often depends on how quickly the heather becomes both woody and unpalatable, and tall and unavailable. After 2/3 years young heather plants will have regenerated from seed or old stools that survived the fire. If the temperature of the burning is too high, or the grazing pressures are high, the critical balance of growth and competition allows fire and grazing-resistant grass species to become dominant, and the heathland is replaced. By creating a patchwork of different aged heathers a gamekeeper aims to have some young heather for grouse, sheep, deer and mountain hares that is nutritionally richer. Patches are burnt every eight to thirty years.

The church, Amsterdam’s oldest, has had every inch of its windows covered with red, inactinic masking film. The colour has a strong symbolic value in art history (the colour of sin, the devil, temptation: we’re in the heart of Amsterdam’s Red Light District) and also in photography where the church feels like the world’s largest darkroom. The windows were for the first two hundred, Catholic, years of the church’s history wildly coloured and pictorial. These were smashed in the Protestant takeover called, rather menacingly, ‘Beeldenstorm’ (statue-storm), part of the Iconclastic Fury of 1566. Red has been absent from these cool, clean, whitewashed interiors ever since. It’s most odd to be suffused in light of such a narrow spectrum. Emerging onto the street was like entering a murky chlorinated swimming pool.

Liwonde National Park was recently on the verge of collapse just 3 years ago -the park was overrun with poaching and more wire snares existed in the park than large animals. But in 2015, @AfricanParksNetwork assumed management of the park on behalf of the Government, and immediately got to work training and outfitting their Ranger unit, preventing poaching, removing almost 30,000 snares, and making the park safe for nature's return. In 2017 they reintroduced cheetahs, and just as of August 16th, they reintroduced lions to restore this iconic species to the park, and help balance natural systems by bringing back critically needed predators. This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. While living with and reacting to those consequences, women are hardly passive victims, though.

To make the 600-mile journey from Agadez, an ancient Nigerien caravan city that has grown into Africa’s most notorious human-smuggling hub, across the Sahara to Libya was to risk death at the hands of bandits, terrorists, and the elements. Then in 2015 the journey became even more perilous. “The army started hunting us,” says Adji, who at 32 had been ferrying migrants to Libya for nearly 15 years. “They are even shooting at our trucks.” I photographed the EU-funded crackdown on Niger’s smuggling industry as part of a special investigation led by @tymccormick5 and published in @foreignpolicymag last year. This series ‘My Smuggler, My Savior’ explores the complicated role these men play in the lives of those attempting the journey to Europe. They’re migrants’ only chance of making it safely across the Sahara. They’re also outlaws engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse with Niger’s military. Adji’s truck was hijacked by bandits in 2016 as he traveled along a new and more dangerous route to Libya.

100 years ago this month saw the beginning of the end of the First World War. 
From 8 August to 11 November 1918 the war entered its final phase during which the Allies (US, British, French... forces)  launched a series of offensives against the Germans on the Western Front.  The offensive essentially pushed the Germans out of France, forcing them to retreat beyond the Hindenburg Line, and was followed by an armistice and the collapse of the German Empire. There were over 1.8 million casualties on both sides.

I've been working for a year now on a larger project about the aftermath of the War. Here at Newfoundland Park on the Somme, the preserved trenches and shell holes are softened, but still preserved.

The practice of recovering gas and oil from shale rock has proved controversial with many protestors in Britain trying to halt exploration of new sites over the past few years. The village of Balcombe in Sussex has seen several confrontations between police and anti-fracking protesters with both local inhabitants and members of the Frack Off national movement opposing petroleum gas exploration plans. Here protestors in the ‘No Dash for Gas’ Action Camp' can be seen trying to prevent a vehicle delivering apparatus to the Balcombe site back in 2013.

This adorable 12-week-old mink kit was found with its siblings when they were just a week old on a cold, rainy night in March when the den their mother had made in a piece of unused construction equipment was destroyed. An attempt to reunite the babies with their mother failed, so they were rescued by Nebraska Wildlife Rehab.  When they first came into care, their eyes were closed, they weighed just a few ounces, and had very little hair.  They had to be fed a specialized formula every two hours until they were stable, and then six times a day until they were weaned onto solid food. They are mischievous animals, which makes them a unique challenge to rehabilitate.  They are fast and love to climb and swim and require extremely specialized housing with a variety of habitats that includes pools and dens. They also must eat on a very regular schedule -- minks, like all weasels, have a high metabolism and aren't able to skip meals like other mammals.  At Nebraska Wildlife Rehab this species makes up a small part of the over 6,000 animals they care for each year, but their unique and challenging personalities always make them a staff and volunteer favorite!  American mink are a common animal near bodies of water throughout North America.  Being semi-aquatic carnivores, they prey on fish, small rodents, reptiles, amphibians and birds. Although this species has a stable population, its cousin (and the only other mink species in the world), the European mink, is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. @newildliferehab To see a photo of the other kits in the litter follow @JoelSartore.",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b81318e63171cf94bd9b43501b47dc5d/5CAD9A0A/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/38902069_573059206443054_2896373241155158016_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg0OTQ3MzI5NjMyNTU0ODc4MA%3D%3D.2

Our animal family is so much like us - they find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families. If we can find a way to believe they think, feel and have emotions we will all be better humans. We need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not.

Jaguars are the 3rd largest of the big cats. Found from US / Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in this area where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguars range. Also poaching for skins, bones and teeth is growing for the first time since the 1970’s to feed the demand for people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth”, Chinese Traditional Medicine and now Luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid 
My first story with big cats was the 1st @natgeo Jaguar story 20 years ago! It has changed my life working with the magical and magnificent cats of the world. Animals have emotions just like we have.

338749,1093,"Photo by @CarltonWard | Summer has come to an end and along with it ghost orchid blooming season in the Everglades. Since June I’ve made near weekly treks into swamps to visit blooming ghosts and service camera traps with precision laser triggers aiming close to blooms. The hope is to answer a mystery to science by capturing unprecedented photographs of a ghost orchid being pollinated. Notice the impressive length of the nectar spur — the thin tube extending from the back of the flower to the right in this photo. Check out @CarltonWard for a different view of this same flower. The giant sphinx moth is thought to be the only pollinator because it’s mouth parts are long enough to reach to the bottom of the nectar spur for the sweet reward that draws the moth deep enough into the flower to get pollen stuck on its head, or to share pollen already there from another ghost. Approximately 2000 ghost orchids exist in the wild, of which one in ten bloom each year and perhaps one in ten of those get pollinated — their only natural means of reproducing. It’s fair to say I’ve become obsessed with these ghosts — their mystery and the magic of the swamps where they survive. For three summers I’ve been drawn deep into the orchids’ watery world and it takes the blooming season ending for me to move on to other work.

Stories from my parents made me realize how much the health of the estuaries and fisheries had degraded in just one generation. For the past dozen years I’ve been focused a bit further inland, working to raise visibility of the Florida Wildlife Corridor — a 17-million acre network of connected wildlife habitat that is very much threatened from expanding roads and development. The Corridor is hidden in plain sight for most of Florida’s 21 million residents and 120 million annual visitors, and same could be said for the Gulf. I am thankful to have experienced the intersection of these two worlds during the 2015 #Glades2Gulf  Expedition (supported by @insidenatgeo). This photo was made on Day 10 of that journey among tendrils of the Chassahowitzska River delta. I couldn’t find my team members to use as subjects during the first of the magical sunrise, so I set my camera on a tripod, started the interval timer and paddled off into the fog. The experience was one of my favorites from the 70-day trek. Later that year, this image was selected as the cover for The Forgotten Coast, made for PBS by @GrizzlyCreekFilms. In many ways, the Gulf of Mexico is America’s Forgotten Coast. Last week the specific region of the Florida panhandle officially known as the Forgotten Coast was devastated by Hurricane Michael.

A green sea turtle swims among a school of surgeonfish in the Southern Line Islands, located in the central Pacific Ocean. Because of their remoteness, these islands and the waters surrounding them remain largely unspoiled and diving the reefs here is like traveling back in time.

Researchers studying coral ecosystems have discovered that a pristine reef has a biomass that is comprised largely of predators, including sharks, snapper and groupers. Sadly, many reef systems around the world today do not have these animals, as they have been fished to dangerously low levels. Every animal plays a vital role in the health of an ecosystem and when individual species are removed, the entire environment breaks down. A healthy ocean is needed for a vibrant planet.

Elephants are lucky enough to have a very varied diet and spend the winter months eating more bark and woody vegetation. After a long winter, the reduced levels of nutrients can begin to take a toll on their condition - particularly in younger animals. The elephants will soon feast on green grass when the rains come, but right now they’re actively digging for rhizomes and bulbs to supplement their woody meals.

This brilliantly colored insect is a critically endangered American burying beetle. This species is an important recycler of nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems! By burying and eating carrion (dead animal flesh) they remove a source of food from flies, which are often pests and health threats. They also feed on fly eggs and larvae, helping to reduce their numbers. The precarious state of the population of American burying beetles was recognized in 1989 when the species was listed as Endangered on the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Endangered Species List.  Reasons for their decline are unknown, but evidence points to habitat loss and fragmentation. Another theory is that this animal thrived by feeding on the now-extinct passenger pigeon, one of the most abundant birds the world had every seen. When they wet extinct, the beetle declined severely. Thankfully, the @stlzoo where this beetle was photographed is committed to working with conservation organizations to assist with declining populations of native plants and animals. The center has successfully bred thousands of American burying beetles on the Zoo campus and, along with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the Missouri Department of Conservation and The Nature Conservancy, the Zoo is reintroducing captive-raised beetles to Southwest Missouri. #Photoark  #americanburyingbeetle  #criticallyendangeredspecies",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/240a2b17451ca20c17a2e1ebd64f4279/5C765929/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/37553124_684317278610612_5363540066729721856_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg1MzQ1OTQ2MjExNTg0OTA5NQ%3D%3D.2

Radiated tortoises have widely been considered the most beautiful tortoise in the world. At one time they were believed to be the world’s most numerous as well, though sadly they have since suffered more than an 80% reduction in their native range. Major causes of decline include habitat destruction for agriculture, horticulture, and charcoal production. Adults are poached for the bushmeat trade, while juveniles are collected illegally for the pet trade by the thousands. Widespread corruption and lack of enforcement under weak governmental control, along with extreme poverty are causing poaching to increase. The @turtleconservancy, where these tortoises were photographed, have partnered with several organizations and zoos to help fight animal trafficking in Madagascar and Asia, identifying trade routes, poachers, and buyers. In April of 2018, more than 10,000 young radiated tortoises were found in a house in Toliara, Madagascar. These animals were sick and held for months without food or water.

Mexican honeypot ants are named for the incredible way they store resources. These ants are like tiny refrigerators, stashing food for the whole colony in anticipation of dry seasons. Designated worker ants called “repletes” hang from the ceiling of their nest, while foraging workers bring them nectar and juices from insect prey-- which is edible with a sweet and tangy flavor. Their abdomens slowly become spherical and transparent as they swell with sugary liquids. They can reach the size of a small grape— some become so large that they cannot leave the nest! All of this work insures that the whole colony can eat even when food is not readily available. These little ants are so full of nutrients that they are often eaten by other animals— even humans. This is one of over 100 species of honeypot ant found in warm arid regions around the world. This species occurs in the southwestern US and northern Mexico, where they feed primarily on nectar and small insects. #honeypotant  #PhotoArk",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bd2dda52d21b41a774daa7a515c54644/5C74691E/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/39320122_1946286015428999_6839246870645047296_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg0ODUwNjgyMjE5ODg1MDk3NA%3D%3D.2

Child labor is defined as work carried out to the detriment and endangerment of a child, in violation of international law and national legislation. It either deprives children of schooling or requires them to assume the dual burden of schooling and work.

Child labor forbidden by law falls into three categories:
1.  Slavery, trafficking, debt bondage and forced labor, forced recruitment for armed conflict, prostitution and pornography, and illicit activities.
2. Labor performed by a child under the minimum age specified for that work. 
3. Labor that jeopardizes the physical, mental or moral well-being of a child.

This little mechanic in the country of Benin works punishing hours in hazardous conditions without pay. Thousands of children in West Africa end up in slavery, in the abuse of an old tradition of sending village children to the cities to live with relatives and work as domestics in exchange for an education. But it has become a professional trafficking operation, with children kidnapped or sold by destitute parents and ending up as unpaid workers in homes, factories and construction sites.

461377,7846,"Photo by @stevewinterphoto | On October 29th, the government of China revealed that it will allow commercial trade in tiger bone and rhino horn from farmed animals for use in traditional Chinese medicine research and clinical treatments.
Debbie Banks, Environmental Investigation Agency UK, Tiger Campaign Director says: “At a single stroke, China has shattered its reputation as a growing leader in conservation following its domestic ban on the sale of ivory at the start of the year. It is instead revealed as a sham, its international image in tatters and its credibility destroyed—and all for the sake of deeply questionable business sectors which serve only to drive consumer demand for the parts and products of endangered species. History will not judge the Government of China kindly or with respect for such a reactionary, ill-judged and damaging decision.”
China’s action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on patients (though the market still existed for them).
This will further the trade in wild tigers, as the “wild tiger” will now be more valuable than farmed.

Marlie, 2017

In the 13th year of Marlie’s life, she was pronounced dead but stubbornly refused to accept the diagnosis.

That’s just like Marlie apparently, who since her “passing” gets along just fine without a spleen and still maintains a well-earned reputation as a Ditch-Dog-Diva, according to those closest to her.

Like the shock of white on her belly, she has an obstinate streak that comes from something in her lineage, a checkering of brave and intelligent breeds that when assembled in close proximity produce the defiant sort you see here.

If I might talk about me for a second, one of the absolute minimal requirements of this whole #yearofthedogs  business is that a dog should remain in front of the camera long enough for me to push the button on said device.

Few dogs have tested my patience as Marlie did. 
And while she might say the same about me, we all know you can’t argue with a dog, particularly one that died and lived to tell about it.

In today’s scenario all is temporary, as the dream of a life position has forever vanished. Usually the first job is the first of a long list that will follow.

The tears rolled down her cheeks - “You always remember - a mother never forgets her children.” Luzmila’s 15-year-old son was taken away during the years of conflict between the military and the Shinning Path. He was never seen again. Peru’s Ashaninka communities like Luzmila’s, which reside in the country’s jungle regions, were devastated by the conflict. She has never stopped fighting for justice and answers about the disappearance of her son. She is not alone. An estimated 20,000 people are still missing.

Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. Women are hardly passive victims though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war. //

Khan emigrated to Astoria, Queens in New York when he was around 4, with his freedom fighter father seeking political asylum in America. Among South Asians, Bangladeshi immigrants are one of the newest and fastest growing immigrant groups in the United States, with nearly half of all Bangladeshi immigrants in this country. Residing in the New York metropolitan area. A major chunk is in the Queens borough. Queens artist Anik was inspired from the music he’d heard in his neighborhood and the spoken-word (kobita) his father would perform at family gatherings. Anik has become a vocal advocate of immigrant pride in his music. His lyrics are often about his dual identities as a Bangladeshi immigrant and a kid from Queens who often describes himself as “curry chicken meets collard greens”. He just released a new single, ""Big Fax."" The opening line of the song goes: ""Damn… It Feels Good To Be An Immigrant."" From belonging to a family seeking political asylum in America, to today becoming a face of the American dream, Anik Khan has come a long way. He thinks it's about time that we flipped the script on outdated immigrant stereotypes.

I did not know about Anik’s music before I moved to America. One of my friends from Boston brought his name up while I was researching my south Asian American project. In my first meeting with Anik I found him very amicable and his ability for spoken poetry stands out from a general conversation with him. We started speaking in Bengali right away. Often times it is a confusing to talk to a Bengali-American: Shall we start in Bengali or English? I think many of south Asians could relate to this confusion.",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/132e1e727031ef2d1a76c3f9625cd9ae/5CAED185/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/40428431_2176185189371631_8755786389717772785_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg2NTgxMDgzMjA2ODM0MTQwNg%3D%3D.2

This month marks the 100th anniversary of the closing of Carlisle, which was the first government off-reservation Indian boarding school in the United States — it would become the model for future boarding schools throughout the U.S. and Canada. Roughly 12,000 Native children attended, many of whom were taken from their families and communities by force in the name of coercive assimilation. This cemetery near where the school once stood is home to the graves of 184 students.

Mr. Sam has spent the past 30 years working to help identify and repatriate the remains of children who died while at boarding schools across the country. He came to Carlisle in early October for a gathering hosted by the Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, which brought together Native boarding school survivors, activists, and many community leaders who, like Mr. Sam, are working to bring the children buried at Carlisle back to their homelands. #carlisle  #indianboardingschool  @nabshc",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f46b8d1b0279fbbe795264fcd4446b4b/5C838505/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/43334582_2300150843345810_3526488088445179623_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg5OTI4Njc0NzQ5NTI2MTE4Ng%3D%3D.2

@Zakouma_National_Park in Chad, @africanparksnetwork, is one of the most amazing ecosystems on the planet – the amazing abundance of life found here is off the charts. Zakouma is just one of 15 parks managed by conservation NGO African Parks (@africanparksnetwork). If you want to see wild plains teeming with lions, leopards, herds of elephants, giraffe, and now rhinos (they just reintroduced black rhinos after a 50-year absence) and no tourists - go to Zakouma - check out the lodges there and in the other parks the manage in 8 other countries via their website. Tourism revenue goes back to the parks they manage and important community projects like education, healthcare and improved livelihoods.
What is happening in Zakouma is one of the most hopeful stories in conservation. The park was once ravaged by poaching and insecurity. More than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory – and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. By 2010, only 450 elephants remained. That same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of Chad to fully manage Zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016.  Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

This change will certainly lead to more pressure on already terribly vulnerable animal populations and place in greater danger the conservationists, rangers and communities who fight for the survival of these majestic creatures. 
Here, Sudan, the last living male Northern White Rhino left on this planet is comforted moments before he passed away March 19, 2018 in northern Kenya. Sudan was brought to Kenya from @safari_park_dvur_kralove in the #Czechrepublic  in 2009. He died surrounded by people who loved him at @olpejeta and has been an inspirational figure for many across the world. If there is any meaning in his death, its that Sudan can be our final wake up call. In a world of 7 billion, we need to start recognizing that we are not separate from nature. When we see ourselves as part of the landscape and part of nature, then saving nature is really about saving ourselves.

Today, fewer 30,000 rhinos and 3,900 tigers remain in the wild. We are witnessing extinction on our watch and must help them by speaking out and supporting conservation efforts worldwide, especially among the indigenous communities who are on the front lines every day against poaching.

And yet - people's amazing ability with tools and intelligence has made our species stronger by far and we are outcompeting every other predator on the planet. Lions are iconic - strong and proud and symbols of power throughout the world. But there are now more statues of lions in the world than there are real lions. Only around 20 000 remain, scattered in ever-smaller patches of wilderness. It's worth noting this decline this #WorldLionDay  but also noting that we have the ability to halt and reverse it when we put our minds to it. Nine years ago, together with @dereckjoubert, and National Geographic, we set up the Big Cats Initiative as a long-term effort to halt the declineof big cats in the wild. The initiative supports efforts to save big cats through assessment, on-the-ground conservation, education, and global public-awareness campaigns. To date, this has supported more than 110 innovative projects in 28 countries that are helping big cats and communities thrive - all working to keep these wild eyes alight across Africa, ready to pierce our souls with the truth about who we really are.

The picture of hunters seen in their blaze orange garments, shotguns held aloft, just beyond the pickup truck in the foreground with a pheasant rooster lying still alongside a bale of straw, was not published in the essay I did called ""Hunters,"" published in the November, 2007 issue of National Geographic.  Both the magazine designer and I wanted this to be the lead picture but it lost out to another image of mine featuring hunters in a vast central Montana field rehabbed by the conservation group @pheasants_forever.  The beauty of the pheasant is apparent in even in death although the brilliance of its coloration I believe lessens in death.  When I was assigned to do the photography for this essay I really thought it would be popular with readers. I feared the recoil by those who might find killing a deer, such a graceful and docile animal, very distasteful if displayed in the magazine.  I could not have been more wrong.  The story ""Hunters"" received more mail than any other story published that year and response by readers was six to one positive.  I  believe the reason was very much influenced by the information given in the article about how hunting is part of the overall effort of conservation and managing wildlife in our country; from license fees wildlife refuges are helped to benefit bird watchers and those who simply enjoy the many areas set aside for wildlife habitat.

Life that is born out of, and maintained by the invisible richness of the seas. 
Walruses are not particularly pretty animals from a distance, but on closer inspection, their face is enchanting. And they don't mind you coming close if you give them enough time to learn that your presence is not a threat. What an experience it was to earn their trust for a few minutes! :-)

In this photo, third generation Apalachicola Kendall oysterman Schoelles tongs for oysters in St Vincent Sound where one million acres of contiguous protected land extend north from the coast, providing crucial wildlife habitat while helping ensure the health of the estuary downstream. Oysters filter the bay to clean the water. In that way, Kendall and oyster men and women like him are protecting the Gulf for all of us, especially as they plant new oyster beds that also help buffer the coast against storms. I trust Kendall has weathered this hurricane. He and his family have weathered storms on the Gulf for more than a century. Hopefully he will be tonging for oysters and caring for the bay again soon. Maybe there will be a silver lining and the hurricane will have dissipated the red tide that has been plaguing the Gulf this summer, arguably exacerbated by pollution from millions of coastal residence who don't live in balance with the ecosystem the way Kendall does. But the Gulf is resilient and balance and sustainability are possible if we all pay attention and do our part.

Fresh back from Afghanistan, with time to reflect on previous trips... more from my work for the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) - here, a photograph of the restored Babur's Garden, nestled in the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains and the fertile alluvial plains of the Kabul River basin. The garden is named after  a young Uzbek Prince, Zahir-ud-Din Muhammad (“Defender of the Faith”; commonly known by his nickname “Babur”) who captured  Kabul in 1504 at the age of 21. Babur's garden is divided into stepped terraces of sixteen levels, and his grave is located near the top of the site. The garden represents an oasis of tranquility surrounded by informal residential development; native species of fruit trees and flowers have been planted in the restored garden.

Our animal family is so much like us: They find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families. If we can find a way to believe they think, feel, and have emotions, we will all be better humans. We need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not.

Jaguars are the third largest of the big cats. They are found from the U.S./Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in Brazil's Patanal, where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguar's range. Poaching for skins, bones, and teeth is also growing for the first time since the 1970s to feed the demand of people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth,” Chinese traditional medicine, and now luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid 
My first story with big cats was the first @natgeo jaguar story 20 years ago! It has changed my life working with the magical and magnificent cats of the world. Animals have emotions just like we have.

The estimated numbers of lions across Africa are approximately 20,000. In Kenya, the national population now numbers less than 2,000 individuals. At current rates of decline, the species could become extinct here within the next two decades. This reduction in lion numbers is primarily due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, typically when lions kill people’s livestock. Lions and other large carnivores are wide-ranging species, and designated protected areas are often not large enough to ensure their long-term survival. It is crucial, therefore, that conservation of these species, as well as their prey, is addressed throughout the landscape, which not only incorporates protected areas, but also the surrounding areas where local people live. @ewasolions is dedicated to conserving lions and other large carnivores by promoting co-existence between people and wildlife, they work hand-in-hand with local communities to provide education, training and improved conservation practices that help people and wildlife, using sound science to help guide the long-term conservation of lions across community conservancies and protected areas in northern Kenya, and I love their work 👍🏿👍🏼💚to see more of it, follow me here @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @natgeo @everydayextinction @ewasolions #conserving  #conservation  #carnevores  #northernkenya  #kenya",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/13e8e019bc7833cda08b0a1e7b94c015/5C716EDA/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/43666353_181924239393917_389349617467748883_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg5NzU1MTc2ODMxNzk1NTYwMw%3D%3D.2

Capturing lions in South Africa to move to Liwonde National Park in Malawi for  @AfricanParksNetwork.
Just as of last week, lions are roaring in Liwonde National Park in Malawi after decades of being extinct thanks to the work of @AfricanParksNetwork , the Malawian Government, @LionRecovery , @leonardodicapriofdn and @leonardodicaprio .
Liwonde National Park was recently on the verge of collapse just 3 years ago -the park was overrun with poaching and more wire snares existed in the park than large animals. But in 2015, @AfricanParksNetwork assumed management of the park on behalf of the Government, and immediately got to work training and outfitting their Ranger unit, preventing poaching, removing almost 30,000 snares, and making the park safe for nature's return. In 2017 they reintroduced cheetahs, and just as of August 16th, they reintroduced lions to restore this iconic species to the park, and help balance natural systems by bringing back critically needed predators. This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

One of life’s greatest misconceptions is a simple fable. That time is a healer. One year ago this week “ethnic cleansing” perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya sparked a massive refugee crisis. Nearly a million Rohingya – those who escaped the flames and executions – are now living in camps in Bangladesh. Many of them were raped, most saw loved ones killed, thousands arrived wounded. All are traumatized. Here, in this impoverished monsoon soaked corner of Bangladesh, is one of the most densely populated areas of PTSD affected and depressed people on earth.

Johura was semi-conscious much of the journey from Myanmar to Bangladesh. She had lost a lot of blood from a bullet that struck her hip. Fortune briefly shone on her during this nightmare. From the shoulder of the man carrying her she shook awake to see a group of boys - one of them her 10-year-old brother - her only surviving sibling. And there is her light - the glimmer of hope in which she might find peace. Neither food, nor friends, nor playing, nor pretty dresses make her happy. How about you brother, does your brother make you happy? “If my brother is happy, that can make me happy - in here, he is the only one who can.”

My English Springer Spaniel Buster scans the Montana fields as we look for grouse or pheasants. In the fall of 2004 Buster and I had driven from our home in Virginia to Montana where we stayed with some of my Hutterite friends at their colony near Stanford, Montana. Buster loved to hunt and it was so good to see him running through the tall reeds and grasses along the creek bottoms, snuffling and snorting, seeking the scent of pheasants that might eventually flush, giving him the chance to leap in a futile attempt to snatch their lengthy tail feathers. Even when he grew old Buster would still tremble at the thought of getting out to hunt. He lived to be thirteen and was a great example of the old saying that the only fault dogs have is that they don't live long enough.

Thanks to strict protection under the Endangered Species Act numbers of the iconic bears have recovered since then from near extinction to more than 700 individuals. This recovery, however, led to Trump administration to de-list the species from federal protection resulting in Wyoming and Idaho to issue trophy hunting licenses for as many as 23 bears.
Just two days before the sports hunt of grizzlies in the area would have started this fall, federal judge Dana Christensen ordered that the grizzly bears kept their protection status.
Less than 2,000 grizzlies call the Lower 48 states their home today, compared to more than 100,000 in historical times. Let give the surviving bears some space. Their habitat has been strongly fragmented, so the remaining bears are distributed over several island populations. 
Bears are facing increased pressure from the effects of climate change, like the loss of important food sources like whitebark pine seeds. It is essential to continue to work on restoring bear habitat, creating wildlife corridors and reconnecting the Yellowstone bears with the other populations of the Lower 48.

He plays multiple instruments, but his favorite is the saxophone. He plays in a jazz group and works with people with many different types of disorders or traumas to cope with, from autistic children to groups of women who have undergone mastectomies. For each person, he designs a special treatment path and a unique musical approach. That’s one more reason why his house is full of a variety of musical instruments from all around the world. Naturally, they have also become his children's playthings. For the moment, Noah is exhibiting a distinct preference for the drums. David was born into an international family, and in his home the language is constantly switching between Italian, French, English and Hebrew /// FATHERS: I’m recently turned 40 and almost every friend around me has become a parent over the last few years. A couple of friends and I are the only ones in our group who still don’t have kids of our own. I naturally began to observe how the others were raising their children. I watch them playing together, hear the arguments and the kids’ complaints at mealtimes or at bedtime. I’ve often been the one in charge of the kids when those moments happen. Just maybe, all of these things are making me start to want to be a father. That is why I’ve decided to make the relationships between fathers and their children the focus of this photo project. Wherever I am in the world, when I meet a father I ask him to tell me about a special moment he has spent with his children and, when I can, I photograph them together /// Follow me for more stories @gabrielegalimbertiphoto #father  #fathers  #dad  #dads  #italy  #firenze  #florence  #music  #musictherapy",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e2715a564cc76e5b851a8da7cc2838ba/5C8D8D46/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/40542884_1833833013380027_4502849147031280641_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg2NTkwMTQ1OTg0NjAwOTc4OQ%3D%3D.2

Socotra is a small island in the Indian Ocean that is part of Yemen. It is far from the main land (about 350 Km) and that has contributed to its historic and biological isolation over the years resulting in an amazing endemic fauna and flora. Surveys have revealed that more than a third of the 800 or so plant species of Socotra are found nowhere else.
It has been till recently a Yemeni military base, were access was very restricted, and this has contributed to preserve it from any kind of mass tourism.

The church was destroyed and almost completely buried by the 1943 - 1952 eruptions of Parícutin volcano in the Mexican state of Michoacán. Parícutin  was the first volcano to be studied by scientists during its full life cycle. The volcano erupted quite suddenly from a farmer's corn field in 1943 and within a day was more than 50 meters tall. By the time the eruption ceased in 1952 the cinder cone was more than 700 meters tall and lava from the volcano had consumed 2 towns. All that stands now in the vast lava field is the remains of this church. Salvador is standing in what was the upper story window. There is more than 30 feet of church wall below him covered in black lava. Parícutin is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, a zone of volcanic activity that covers central southern Mexico.

169339,2187,"Photo by @brentstirton | This is an image of illegal #ivory  seized in Kenya destined for Japan. The hundreds of ivory tubes are pre-cut “hankos,” a highly desirable personal stamp in Japan. Ivory in Japan plays out in musical instruments, hankos and netsuke, small ivory carvings. On more than one occasions I was offered ivory that it is illegal to export. Online, Yahoo! Japan offers illegal ivory for sale immediately accessible to a consumer market. In a recent environmental investigation, I worked with National Geographic writer Rachel Nuwer to examine Japan’s decision to continue with its domestic ivory market, despite China closing theirs in January 2018. This makes Japan the largest legal ivory market in the world. They have taken an attitude similar to their stance on whaling, placing a sense of nationalistic pride ahead of the lives of #elephants , some of the most sentient and #endangered  animals on the planet. Japan has consumed ivory from at least 262,500 elephants since 1970, the vast majority from large, mature adults, according to Allan Thornton, president of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). Japan’s ivory industry today, Thornton adds, is “greater than any other nation on Earth.” While China had some 170 ivory outlets nationwide prior to its ban, Japan has 8,200 retailers, 300 manufacturers, and 500 wholesalers. “In the 1980s Japan was so notorious, not only in terms of the volume of ivory it consumed but also for illegal trade,” says Isao Sakaguchi, a professor of international relations and global environmental governance at Gakushuin University, in Tokyo. “Japan was responsible for the near extinction of African elephants in most of their range states.” Legal trade in ivory inevitably creates loopholes for illegal trade and #Japan  has loopholes you can drive a ship through. National Geographic writer Rachel Nuwer has done a superb job of reporting on the implications of Japan’s decision to continue with their ivory trade. I would urge anyone who cares about animals to read this illuminating feature on @natgeo online. #illegalivory   @eiaenvironment #ivorytrade  #endangeredanimals  #japanivory  #liveforthestory",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/18662c285da3c5bac2b4c956d4dcfb0a/5C8D2436/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/41598444_320136861899949_8144769929563409299_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg3OTQ5MTEzMDkxMTkzNTE5NQ%3D%3D.2

377075,1938,"Photo by @williamalbertallard | Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, 1964. This gently portrait of an Amish boy holding his pet guinea pig started my career as a professional photographer and my 50 years as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine.

In the spring of 1964, I was blessed with getting a photographic internship at National Geographic in Washington D.C. after showing my portfolio of work to Robert E. Gilka, the legendary director of photography at National Geographic. As my first assignment as an intern, Gilka sent me to Lancaster County, PA to cover a Pennsylvania Dutch festival. """"Try to get some pictures of the Amish, if you can,"""" he told me. It seemed the magazine had a finished manuscript about the Amish but had no pictures. He didn't tell he'd earlier sent a staff photographer to Pennsylvania who'd come back with nothing. Although I photographed the festival events my success with the Amish came through driving the country roads, introducing myself to Amish farmers, many of whom turned me down but eventually finding one who allowed me to photograph his family and their way of life.  My first assignment which was to have been for a weekend or perhaps a week, lasted through much of the summer and into the fall of 1964.  On an overcast afternoon, after photographing an Amish farmer working in his fields I was brought to the barn by his son so he could show me his pet guinea pig.  My portrait of the boy and his pet became the lead picture in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster county published in the August, 1965 issue, a story which has been credited as the beginning of a new, more intimate look at people in the National Geographic Magazine.

The birds were feeding their young when this picture was made last month, right now they will be leaving the Arctic to migrate south for their 'second summer'. Arctic terns are famous for their epic migration (the longest of any bird) and for the fearless way they attack predators approaching the colony. Other birds will often choose to nest near Arctic tern colonies, using them for protection against predators. Watching them through my lens this summer, I would describe them as a small bird with a lot of strength and ‘attitude’.

Socotra (Arabic: سُقُطْرَى‎ Suquṭra), is an archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea and territorially part of Yemen. The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula and 240km (150mi) east of the Horn of Africa. It has been described as """"the most alien-looking place on Earth”. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life isn't found anywhere else on Earth.  In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 endemic species; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more.

Fluid, that’s how Aart Aarsbergen @aart_natgeo (former Editor-in-Chief of the Dutch edition of National Geographic Magazine poetically described Rottumeroog; a place continuously shaped by the elements.

Which as a magazine editor made him a little nervous.

After signing their marriage certificate, the bride and groom bowed to their parents. “Now that you are married to each other, don’t forget to call your parents,” said the registrar who married them, “and come to visit them.” That simple advice to the newlyweds, the kind that most newlyweds elsewhere may receive, was also a reminder that in these front-line areas of a war that has simmered for years, many young people leave for safer places while their parents stay behind.

It has been more than four years since the war in Ukraine began. The front line is static and life around it is pretty normal—or so it seems. People in conflict zones get used to danger. Like everywhere else, they work, cook, have fun, fall in love, get married and raise children.

""It was early in the morning when the military arrived,"""" says 22 year old Rohingya refugee Tayeba Khatun. ""The military went house to house; eventually they came to ours. They took away my father-in-law and brother-in-law.” After taking the men, the soldiers came for the women. “When I was being dragged out my husband tried to save me. He was shot dead,” says Tayeba. She was taken to a nearby abandoned house. “There were five military men. Three stood outside to manage the situation, two raped me… they raped me until I lost consciousness. When I woke, I collected my children and escaped.” Pushing through the pain of the rape and the loss of her husband Tayeba trekked through sucking mud and monsoon-swollen rivers towards Bangladesh.

Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. While living with and reacting to those consequences, women are hardly passive victims, though. They grieve, they fight against the suffering, and many find they are forced to re-invent themselves, shedding an old identify and forging a new one shaped by war.

Amazon tree boas are found in South America , from Colombia to Bolivia. They grow to almost 6 feet in length and have an incredible, almost unparalleled, array of color morphs and patterns in the wild. Like pit vipers, Amazon tree boas have pit organs that sense heat and help them hunt, which means they are quick to strike at anything warm, including human hands. Amazon tree boas are also known for having an attitude, and I can say for sure this particular snake wasn’t very happy we found it (of course if a giant creature found you you’d likely be grumpy too!), but within 5 minutes she calmed, letting me get just an inch or two from her for this snake portrait that is a part of long term project on snakes I’m doing with @paulrosolie.

They show so much activity at the water’s surface: Slapping their tail, trumpeting from their blow hole, splashing with their pectoral fins. The most breathtaking of it all is when a 30-ton whale breaches right in front of you. 
I was sailing in south east Alaska when we came across this individual. It catapulted its body repeatedly out of the water. The breaching rarely happens multiple times in the same exact spot, so one has to develop a certain intuition where the whale might come up next. After a serious of failures, I finally got this image. For me humpbacks breaching is one of the most exciting wildlife spectacles. 
Humpback whales were almost hunted to the brink of extinction until they were protected in 1966.

I just returned from a trip to Switzerland with Klaus Thymann of @projectpressure to photograph the Rhône Glacier in southern Switzerland, which is disappearing at a colossal rate. 
Because there is a small shop there that carves an ice grotto into the glacier and charges tourists to experience inside the blue ice, it has been worth their money attempting to slow the glacier’s retreat. They have invested heavily in a special thermal blanket that has kept about 25m (82ft, in depth) of ice from disappearing, and has kept the ice grotto intact. However, after a few harsh winters on the mountain, the blanket is starting to disintegrate. And unfortunately the method is not scaleable: we cannot do this to all the world’s ice; the gesture is as forlorn and doomed as the glacier itself. So with heavy lament, this glacier, which has existed for millennia, will die within the lifetime of children born today.

I looked at some of my notes I took when we followed this mother bear: “Over the course of the week, our polar bear mother (as we came to think of her) sometimes walked within twenty feet of the boat and simply lay down on the ice floe and fell asleep. But she did not stop there. After resting for a while, she sat up, took a look around, and invited the cubs to nurse. She fell into a kind of trancelike state, letting her head slowly sink down in exhaustion as her cubs drank. I can still clearly hear the suckling sounds in my mind and even noticed a purring from the cubs. It was an unforgettable sight: mother and cubs, nestled together on the ice in the warm late-evening light, with drifting sea ice leading to the horizon where it meets the edge of the Austfonna ice cap in Svalbard.” In late August polar bears are hanging on to the last of the drifting sea ice. To successfully raise her cubs, this mother needs the sea ice platform to hunt for seals. 
I was in awe. This bear completely trusted us. After taking the first pictures of this scene, I remember how I quickly rushed to the bow of the boat. I was not happy with the earlier framing of the image.

309388,722,"Photo by @CarltonWard | Did you know that the first modern cattle and horses in the United States landed on the Gulf coast of Florida in 1521? Ponce de Leon brought them on sailing ships from Spain during his second voyage to the New World. Although he was attacked by Calusa Indians (and later died of his wounds in Havana), cattle and horses remained. When my ancestors migrated into Florida in the mid 1800s, cattle had been living wild in the Florida woods for nearly three centuries. Descendants of these original Spanish livestock are called """"cracker"""" cattle and horses today. Early American settlers of the Florida frontier were also called """"crackers"""", attributed to the """"crack"""" of their cow whips. Modern horses actually evolved in North America but vanished during the mass extinction of mammals 13,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age, around the same time when the human population was expanding throughout the continent. Much of the southeastern US was adapted to grazers. There were herds of wild bison in Florida as recently as the 1700s (and perhaps later). There are places today, such as the grasslands and prairies of the Northern Everglades, where modern cattle serve a beneficial role in maintaining native ecosystems.

995965,5343,"Photograph by @florianschulzvisuals // When I shot the images for my @natgeo story on polar bears, I spent quite a bit of time out on boats in the Arctic ocean. I was hours up in the crows nest scanning the horizon for little cream-colored specs on the remaining ice. Bears try to hang on to the ice where they can hunt seals as long as they can before they head to land where there is almost no food for them. 
In the recent years, we have seen a dramatic sea ice loss that has left polar bears without their hunting platform. This image symbolically shows the fate of the polar bear. This mother and cub are clinging on to this tiny ice floe surrounded by freezing water. Polar bears are excellent swimmers but the longer the distances get, the more energy the animals lose and young cubs often don't survive the long swims. The longest recorded traverse of a female polar bear lasted 9 days and covered 687 km (426 miles). Her cub died during this swim and she lost 22% of her body weight. We should all care! Temperatures in the Arctic are rising at twice the speed but the effects of climate change can be felt everywhere. Record-breaking heat, stronger hurricanes, more severe droughts, floods and devastating wildfires. Climate change is real and we need to finally address it in major ways.

305194,593,"Photo by @paleyphoto (Matthieu Paley) | Paul Salopek (@outofedenwalk) making his way up Irshad, a remote mountain pass connecting Afghanistan and Pakistan. At this stage, he had walked all the way from Ethiopia. The next day, because of a mix up, Paul and I were arrested by the secret service. Here is an extract from Paul’s evocative text, from the September issue of @natgeo magazine:
""Early that morning, in a coarse ice mist, we set out with two pack donkeys to climb Irshad Pass. Climbing a mountain under such conditions is a strange and disorienting experience. It was like scaling a frozen and crazily tilted sea. We tottered along ice-rimed cliffs. Snow hid fatal crevices. Sometimes the donkeys fell through the crust and refused to get up. By midday a blizzard was in full gust.
“Hello, Arthur, can you do me a favour?” Paley was shouting into the satellite phone. We couldn’t see a hundred steps ahead, much less the peaks far above. Paley’s brother in Paris googled and read out to us the GPS coordinates for Irshad.
Irshad Pass rises to 16,335 feet above sea level. We finally reached it at sunset. Paley ventured a feeble victory dance. I gulped air so thin and metallic it cut my lungs like razor blades. Gales had scoured the summit to raw bedrock. Without shelter or firewood, it was a hazardous place to camp. But we had little choice.
Plainclothes Pakistani security forces confronted us the next night while we camped at the eastern end of the Hindu Kush. We had notified the government of our plan to enter Pakistan via Irshad. We carried valid visas issued in advance. But the officers, armed with AK-47s, insisted we had trespassed into a restricted zone. Overnight, they drove us to the frontier town of Gilgit. In detention there, I overheard Paley, curled on his cot, parroting in his emphatic Norman accent the lines from a film playing on his hidden mobile phone: “An eye for an eye only ends up making see whole world blind.” “Matthieu,” I whispered, “are you watching Gandhi in an intelligence agency safe house?”

161675,3018,"Photo by @martinschoeller | Religion: Orthodox Judaism. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach: "" I was born Jewish and as I grew older, after my parents divorced, I increased my dedication to my faith and decided as a teenager to become a rabbi.

Judaism strongly believes in the power of prayer. It has a set prayer book which is taken from biblical sources, like the Book of Psalms, rabbinic sources.. and it essentially constitutes two parts. One being praise for God and the other being penitential prayer, which acknowledges the human dependency on God for our basic needs. Judaism specifically places the struggle for righteousness above perfection, to battle our nature, to be better. But it defines being better not first and foremost in terms of character improvement but in terms of societal improvement. 
In religious terms I would say that Judaism places world redemption above personal salvation. Like, whether you're going to heaven or hell is not a question that is emphasized, whether you contributed to feeding the hungry and clothing the naked and giving sight to the sightless is much more significant.

The Torah is the most important text, the five books of Moses. And then beyond that there's twenty-four books of the Bible. And then the rabbinical interpretations of those five books, which is called the Talmud. 
The message is that God gave ten commandments to the Jewish people, which are a code of ethical monotheism. God communicates with humans and imparts His will. In Judaism, membership in the faith is communicated either through birth to a Jewish mother or conversion to Judaism. But remember, Judaism is not just a religion; we are also a people, we're a nation. That's entry and participation in that people. 
My faith gives me a moral code by which to live.

222429,578,"Photo by @brentstirton | Zackouma National Park, Chad. Djime Said, 50, is the lone survivor of a Conservation Ranger massacre at Heban, Chad. Six Zakouma National Park rangers died in an attack by poachers who were members of the Sudanese military. A few weeks earlier, the Rangers found the poachers camp and took all their ammunition, their poached ivory and provisions. The poachers were out of camp at the time. These poachers then planned a counter-attack that began just before first light while the Rangers were sleeping. They would have woken to a hail of A.K rounds, the last sound they would ever hear. Djime Said was employed as a cook with the rangers in the rainy season. In his account, he said the pre-dawn night was very still when suddenly there was heavy firing out of nowhere. He found himself rolling down the steep hill that made up the Ranger post at Heban. He was shot but managed to hide away for the day and then come back to the camp that night where he confirmed that all the rangers were dead and the camp looted. He spent the next week trying to get help, two days of which were spent wading through a dense swamp on his way to aid. He received $2000 compensation from the Chadian government for his injuries but told me he no longer wanted to work for Zakouma after this experience. Since the time of the attack, the parks “Mamba” teams have greatly improved security, this coupled with better relations with the nomads in the region have developed an intelligence network that safeguards both the animals and the people trying to protect them. Every year many rangers die protecting a global heritage, they work for a pittance and endure conditions most humans would balk at. They do most of that with a smile on their faces. Surely we owe them more. #africaparks  #zakouma  #conservationrangers  #natgeo  #survivors",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/94b616298fc9f24f155c2ce54e6024e0/5CB03BDA/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/41728105_384086782132193_8283457459586192575_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg4NTQ1NTQ5MDgxNzc2ODgzNQ%3D%3D.2

The Old Man of Storr, Isle of Skye, Scotland. As part of the Trotternish ridge - a 300m thick sandwich of around 24 layers of volcanic rock - the Storr was created by a massive ancient landslide, leaving one of the most iconic rock formations on the British Isles. The area in front of the cliffs is known as the Sanctuary, which has a number of weirdly shaped rock pinnacles created from the crumbling basalt.  Legend has it that the Old Man of Storr gets its name because the rock outline and the protruding pinnacle resemble that of the face of an old man. Storr means big in Norse. Near the summit of the Storr, you can find one of Scotland’s rarest plants, Iceland Purslane.

133598,1293,"Photo by @martinschoeller | Religion: Bruderhof. Michelle Hinkey: """"I grew up in a Christian home with my parents and five siblings. I attended schools run by the Bruderhof, which is a Christian communal movement. But believing in and following Christ is not something anyone else can do for me. I had to discover my own beliefs and faith. Unlike most Christian denominations, the Bruderhof doesn’t have consecrated church buildings. When the weather is nice, we often worship outdoors. In our community in Harlem, we have a rooftop deck, where we hold many of our worship meetings. As it says in Matthew 18:20 “For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."" Jesus told his disciples that there are two great commandments. First: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. And secondly: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” My first task is to love and serve God, but my love to him is expressed through the love I show my neighbors. The best way for me to love God and my neighbors is by living in a Bruderhof community. For my community, the Sermon on the Mount is particularly important. In it, Jesus teaches us how to live a life of love, humility, service, purity, and forgiveness. Jesus also talks a lot about the Kingdom of God. Some people make this out just to be what’s beyond the grave. It’s not! It’s a blueprint, a model for how we ought to live. It is a kingdom of justice, of peace, of love. We can’t force it into being, but we can try our best to live it out in our own lives. 
I think every day I lose my faith and find it again. Sometimes it is hard to believe in a good God when I see all the suffering and problems in the world today, or even if I’m just having a bad day. But then I look around and see God’s work and beautiful creation in so many amazing and interconnected ways, people, friends, children, nature, trees, microorganisms. So I have to believe even if I don’t understand it all!""",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7d9d1f6c487026c9673a54637d5ad858/5CAFF183/t51.2885-15/e35/40476593_198423747718206_8166201990518429093_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg2NDc2NjI4MzEyOTUzNTczMg%3D%3D.2

Have you ever wondered why zebras have stripes? There are five main hypotheses for what stripes do for this species. They are thought to: repel insects, provide camouflage through optical illusion, confuse predators, reduce body temperature, and help the animals recognize each other. Among the many theories, recent research found that zebras and certain blood-sucking insects inhabit the same places. Understanding how the stripe pattern impacts bug bites on this species may help researchers protect humans from disease-carrying insects! This species can digest taller, tougher grasses that other grazing animals have difficulty eating. As they migrate, they often move into new areas first. As they eat the high grasses, spurring more nutritious green plants to appear, allowing wildebeest and gazelles to roam in and eat. Some say zebras are white because the stripes end at their white belly. Others say black because when you shave the hair, the skin is mostly black.  What do you think?

This is a critically endangered helmeted hornbill, found only in Sumatra and Borneo, with rare residence in the Malayan peninsula and southern Thailand. Unique to this hornbill species, the casque of this bird is solid ivory, and because of this they have been heavily poached in the ornamental trade. The hornbill’s casque, or “helmet”, allows them to pick up and manage food, helps to resonate sound when calling, and it has been suggested that the hornbill can also use the casque like a hammer.  Another threat to this species are native peoples in the Malaysian Peninsula, who hunt them due to the belief that their casques can protect them from evil spirits. The Penang Bird Park in Malaysia where this bird was photographed works to conserve this species and breed them in captivity. This bird is one of two helmeted hornbills at the park that were saved and donated by a local lumberjack who found the female and a her baby in the tree while he was working.  Knowing how rare this species was, he made sure to deliver the hornbills to Penang, where they have been carefully taken care of and kept healthy since their arrival. #Photoark  #helmetedhornbill  Follow @joelsartore to see a video of this hornbill!",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2af7b0d61a43c67cacacd7e6c9af5c5c/5C8EBB49/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/39114675_553776335040348_8353829781493514240_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg0NTQ4NjkzNTUzMzM5MzA1NA%3D%3D.2

352192,1553,"Photo by @jenniferhayesig | Today is whale shark day. Excited tourists observe a whale shark that has surfaced to eat a handful of krill from a guide in a small wooden outrigger near Oslo, in the Philippines. Each day hundreds of people journey to this small seaside village to watch and swim with these gentle filter feeding giants. Operations begin at 6 am and cease at 12:30 after which the whale sharks descend into the depths and the tourists melt away. The encounter begins with an orientation about whale sharks and a set of approach rules that include keeping 5 meters from head, no touching, chasing or blocking. Long lines of tourists form as they wait for a paddler to guide a small group through the offshore loop of boats for a 30 minute experience with the sharks. The practice of feeding (provisioning) the animals with handfuls of krill is highly controversial. Supporters maintain that the whale sharks have a historic presence here and can come and go; that the practice has broadly increased the local standard of living by providing employment to fisherman and decreasing the local fishing pressure; and that the sharks have become ocean ambassadors introducing thousands to marine life, increasing ocean awareness and hopefully stewardship. On the other hand, many conservation groups and scientists recognizes that this tourism may come at a cost to the whale sharks. Research suggests that feeding modifies their natural behavior through longer residency with an unknown impact of retained congregations on their local food resources, social structure, migration, reproduction and overall health. Whale sharks, once a heavily targeted fishery in the Philippines and Taiwan, are now protected in both countries and are endangered, but remain at risk of poaching and are actively fished in China and other countries for the lucrative shark fin trade. These giants are the world’s largest fish but much of their biology still remains a mystery as their populations decline around the planet. // From @natgeo assignment Philippines, An Ocean Nation // #WhaleSharkday  #Ocean  #Philippines  #Shark  #Ecotourism  #OceanConservation  #CoralTriangle  for #MoreOcean  follow @JenniferHayesig",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/73da9a2d49d0bab0004716c8acaccaee/5C724A5F/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/40006115_166351764215069_3028755325902651392_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg1NzczMDEwMjc1MDYyODgxNg%3D%3D.2

599054,1970,"Photo by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | A hiker thinks twice before attempting to climb down old Moki steps (hand and foot holds carved into the near-vertical sandstone) once used to access these Ancestral living and storage structures in #BearsEarsNationalMonument , Utah.  The structures most likely date between 900-1250 CE. #MokiSteps  can be found all over the American southwest.  With a potential fall of a couple hundred feet, this hiker chose not to enter the cave.  If you encounter any site like this please DO NOT ENTER it.  #VisitWithRespect  Follow @argonautphoto to learn more about the Ancestral Pueblo people and to see more images that show how high up these dwellings are!",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c0d6a99d82318432b82a6c0641e009db/5CB1EFC4/t51.2885-15/e35/43385931_180148289529795_7287557780018867276_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTg5NTI0Mjc4MDEwOTE0NjYwMw%3D%3D.2

The couple's son was studying for a business school entry exam in their crowded home. The slum had no working toilets at the time. India is focusing on supplying ""a toilet for every Indian"" by 2019, making proper sanitation its goal. #india  #sanitation  @noorimages",https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/05f3444a2ff1aed3e7f72b0804ff0bd6/5C72B22D/t51.2885-15/fr/e15/s1080x1080/42411940_318496015582227_3687512440208001054_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTg4MDg4MDY5MDUwNjAxODM5MA%3D%3D.2
