A West Indian Manatee calf nurses from its mom as they settle down on the sandy sea floor in the waters off the coast of Belize, an important country for these endangered animals. Manatees here live in mangroves and often sleep there overnight and feed on nearby sea grass beds during the day. Unlike Florida manatees, these animals are not nearly as acclimated to humans and are shyer. On this morning however, this very relaxed mom and calf allowed me into their world.

Historically these animals have thrived in this region, where come for a few weeks each year to engage in courtship, mating and pupping. But declining sea ice due to climate change over the last decade has caused problems for this species for without stable ice, the pups cannot suckle from their moms and may fall into the icy sea before they are physically prepared. Survival for this species is uncertain if these trends continue.

This area was inhabited for centuries by the San people; rock paintings can be found in caves and shelters across the reserve. An area of climatic extremes, with very cold winters; there is often snow on the mountains and temperatures fall well below zero, with summers that can be uncomfortably hot, with temperatures reaching mid 40 degrees Celsius and higher.
This mountain range is part of the Cape Fold mountain system and the geological formations are chiefly of the Table Mountain group - The reserve’s vegetation is remarkably diverse, featuring renosterveld, mountain fynbos, Karoo-veld, spekboom-veld, and numerous geophytes species.  Most plants flower in spring and some of the low lying areas are transformed into a wonderland as the first rains occur and the dormant plants display their true colours in vast abundance.
Mammals present here include klipspringer, grey rhebuck, kudu, baboon and dassie (rock hyrax). Leopard and caracal (lynx). More than one hundred and thirty bird species have been recorded here, notably black eagle, fish eagle, martial eagle, cape sugarbird and giant kingfisher - love this mountain range, it truly looks like its made from folded layers of marzipan 💚 follow me @chancellordavid to see more work and projects from here and elsewhere #swartbergmountains  #southafrica  #conserving  #wildlife """,1

Debbie Banks, Environmental Investigation Agency UK, Tiger Campaign Director says: “At a single stroke, China has shattered its reputation as a growing leader in conservation following its domestic ban on the sale of ivory at the start of the year. It is instead revealed as a sham, its international image in tatters and its credibility destroyed—and all for the sake of deeply questionable business sectors which serve only to drive consumer demand for the parts and products of endangered species. History will not judge the Government of China kindly or with respect for such a reactionary, ill-judged and damaging decision.”
China’s action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on patients (though the market still existed for them).
This will further the trade in wild tigers, as the “wild tiger” will now be more valuable than farmed.

The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 240km (150mi) east of the Horn of Africa and 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species – up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as ""the most alien-looking place on Earth”. In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 species found nowhere else on earth; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more impressive numbers.

Here is a mom and her cubs in the @africanparksnetwork @Zakouma_National_Park. Just 100 years ago there may have been as many as 500,000 lions which roamed the African continent but today there it is estimated that as few as 16,000 - 30,000 remain, and research by lion biologist Hans Bauer and colleagues suggests lions in much of west, east and central Africa will decline by 50% in the next two decades if something dramatic is not done! The biggest threats facing lions in Africa are poaching of their prey and retaliatory killings by farmers when lions eat their cattle! There is also an emerging threat of lions being used in Chinese medicine as tigers become rarer.  @wildaid ""When the buying stops the killing can too”

Poisonings and poaching are the main threats to lions across their East African range. Most lion populations in East, Central and West Africa are declining so the time to act is now. 
There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

Mature longleaf pines develop charismatic flat-top canopies after 150-or-so years when they start putting more energy into growing out than up. There are trees on Eglin that are 500-years-old, pre-dating when Columbus arrived in the New World. Once covering 90 million acres of the southeastern United States, only three million acres of longleaf remain. Conservation groups are working to restore longleaf from Florida to Georgia, Alabama and beyond. The region is an inspiration and potential proving grounds for E.O. Wilson’s “Half Earth” vision. Longleaf pine forests and savannas are among the most biologically diverse habitats on Earth. They are home to numerous endangered species, and will be crucial to the recovery of the endangered Florida panther as the population expands northward out of the Everglades.

As Americans celebrate the Labor Day holiday, please spare a thought for the more than 150 million children worldwide (UNICEF estimate) engaged in child labor. This little construction worker in the country of Benin works punishing hours on building sites, carrying loads far too heavy for his size, without pay. Thousands of children in West Africa end up in slavery in the abuse of an old tradition of sending village children to the cities to work in exchange for an education. Instead, they end up as unpaid workers in homes, factories and construction sites.
//
Child labor is defined as work carried out to the detriment and endangerment of a child, in violation of international law and national legislation. It either deprives children of schooling or requires them to assume the dual burden of schooling and work.
//
Child labor forbidden by law falls into three categories:
Slavery, trafficking, debt bondage and forced labor, forced recruitment for armed conflict, prostitution and pornography, and illicit activities; labor performed by a child under the minimum age for that work; and labor that jeopardizes the physical, mental or moral well-being of a child.

I got to work in India for the first time in what was kind of the twilight of my career that dates back to 1964.  I was assigned by @natgeo to photograph the Dalits, also known as the Untouchables, those people who exist on the lowest rung of the India caste system.  This man has just emerged from cleaning out a sewer filled with filth by using only a bucket and a rope.  After finishing and closing the concrete cover, he had to go to several nearby homes before gaining permission to wash himself off with a garden hose.  Because he is an Untouchable he is destined to do what his father, his grandfather, and all the men in his family's past did, to clean waste from sewers.  There are Untouchables generations destined to a tradition of washing clothes, or tanning leather hides, or other tasks members of the upper castes refuse to do.  Despite his situation, this man who sits covered in sewage, wears a thin gold chain around his neck and I was struck by how it seemed to match the glint of pride in his eyes as I made his portrait.  He may be a collector of other people's wastes, but he does so with self esteem.

I applied wanting to reconnect with the fundamentals of photojournalism and push to develop a picture story around the lives of people I had never met in a place I didn’t know. After two years of chasing Florida panthers with camera traps nearly full time, it had become common for weeks to go by without holding a camera in my hands. So I set the high-tech equipment aside and went to Missouri with just one camera for an immersive experience that involved a lot of looking, listening and waiting. Each student was limited to just 400 photos for the week, with no deletions. When I am on assignment, I often shoot 1000 photos in a day. But the workshop leaders encouraged us to trust the process and to be intentional about the moments we tried to capture. By watching and waiting we would know when a moment was building and we should trust ourselves respond. By Wednesday evening I had watched the Fry brothers drive the tractor two previous times. But when I saw this sunset forming and heard the tractor coming on the third night, I started running down the hill, remembering the floodlights on the cab that could balance exposure with the western sky. Had I not been watching the farm work for two days, I wouldn’t have reacted when this moment presented itself. See the full story and inspiring work from other students through the link in my bio @carltonward.

My assignment to photograph Peru as a country story for @natgeo magazine had an incredible impact on my life both professionally and personally. I was coming out of a period where Id concentrated on the American West; about a 13 year love affair with the West. I realized I had to go to a different well if my work was going to grow; I had to find a different palette, a different culture. I heard through the grapevine that the magazine was going to do a story about Peru and I somehow felt an absolute need to get the assignment to do the photography. Here, in this image, done within just a few days of my arrival in Peru, I was in a small Andean village where six people had been killed by an earthquake. The Peruvian government had sent a helicopter with a medical team and a priest to the village and these young girls are peering, open mouthed, and awestruck. They had never seen a doctor before. While working in Peru I met and fell in love with a woman who several years later would become my wife. She was walking through the Plaza des Armas in Ayacucho during Easter week in 1981. I followed her around the Plaza for a while before building the courage to ask if she spoke English which she firmly answered, """"No"""". And that was that until another day not much later when I was able to engage her in an invitation to join my group to attend a cultural event one night, and with that evening the beginning of our romance took flame. And it still burns 37 years and counting.

If you want to see wild plains teeming with lions, leopards, herds of elephants, giraffe, and now rhinos (they just reintroduced black rhinos after a 50-year absence) and no tourists - go to Zakouma - check out the lodges there and in the other parks the manage in 8 other countries via their website. Tourism revenue goes back to the parks they manage and important community projects like education, healthcare and improved livelihoods.
What is happening in Zakouma is one of the most hopeful stories in conservation. The park was once ravaged by poaching and insecurity. More than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory – and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. By 2010, only 450 elephants remained. That same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of Chad to fully manage Zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016.  Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

The cave of Altamira was reported in 1880 by Don Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. It was the first paleolithic art cave to be identified. The cave was first greeted with amazement but the discovery soon deteriorated into deep controversy that followed Marcelino Sanz de Salutoula to his grave. In the 1880s it was thought that prehistoric humans lacked the capacity for abstract thought. Paintings like this could not have possibly been made by Ice Age people. It was not until other paleolithic art caves were discovered in France that Altamira was accepted as genuine. 
Archaeological deposits in the cave place human occupation between the Upper Solutrean and Lower Magdalenian eras (18,500-14,000 BCE). Uranium/Thorium dating of calcite deposits on top of some of the artworks place the works within the Aurignacian and Solutrean periods (36,000-22,000 BCE). This U-T dating suggests that Altamira was painted over a period of more than 10,000 years.

Bhante Heenbunne Kondanna: “I live in a temple on Staten Island. We have a big Sri Lankan community there so most of them are Buddhist. Very basically, Buddhism, if I explain it, is not to do evil. Do good, purify your mind. Not to do anything wrong, which is hard. So you need a definition for that. Whatever’s harmful to you and to the other person is not good. Whatever is beneficial to you and to the other person is good. Either good or bad go into the category of Karma. So you stay on the good side, the positive side. How do you do that? 
By practicing meditation, refining your mind. You know, our minds, we have so much luggage in there. Be aware of it. 'I can show you the path but you have to walk the path', that’s what the Buddha said. When you practice meditation, you can see yourself.

Greed, hatred and ignorance are the three root causes of all these crazy things that we do. Free yourself, find your own peace. That’s the central message that Buddha gave. There are a lot of things that we are doing habitually and so what he was encouraging is don’t live habitually, live mindfully. When you are mindfully living, you are concentrated about other people. Life is like a bubble of water…like a dew drop which is hanging on the tip of a leaf. Any time it’s fragile, any time it can drop off. So therefore, uncertainty is always there so don’t leave any room for regret, do nice things. Do things that you can be happy [about] so that you are always prepared. What Buddha said was ‘may all beings be well and happy.’ That’s all. You can practice it. Practice it like a mother who has only one child. She will be risking her life to save her only child. So we must have that quality within us. Use that same kind of love to all beings.”",0

This animal behavior is so similar in many ways to us as humans! Our animal family is so much like us - they find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families. If we can find a way to believe they think, feel and have emotions, we need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not.

Jaguars are the 3rd largest of the big cats. Found from US / Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in this area where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguars range. Also poaching for skins, bones and teeth is growing for the first time since the 1970’s to feed the demand for people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth”, Chinese Traditional Medicine and now Luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid

Our oceans are home to most of the life on our planet and play a central role in the world's natural systems, like regulating our climate, absorbing carbon dioxide and they produce over half the oxygen that we, and all other land animals, breathe.

The portrait of the fragile but seemingly unafraid little girl seen alongside the heads of two enormous draft horses was published in the August, 1964 issue of National Geographic in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  The child was with her father who was working in his fields.  At some point in the afternoon she was standing in the back of a farm wagon, the horses, unhitched, were about to be led to the barn and for a moment they provided the background for her profile.  Her blouse appears worn, perhaps a bit dirty from childish play, and its pale blue color seems to echo the softness in the child's light complexion and wispy, blond hair.  Photographing the Amish was the beginning of my photographic depiction of several subcultures in my country and elsewhere during the 1960's.  My essays on the Amish in 1964, the Basques of France and Spain in 1968, and the Hutterites of Montana in 1969, all dealt with the lives of people living in a culture of their own.

This is probably a good thing, because wild lesser flamingos have specialized diets of blue-green algae and diatoms. Their diet restricts their habitats to hyper-alkaline and soda lakes and is also the reason for their pink coloring! The pigment of their feathers, legs, and face all come from the organisms they eat. As the blue-green algae they consume is digested, the pigments dissolve in fats and is transferred into the feathers, through this process the color becomes pink. Variations in their coloring can happen based on the volume they ingest. They are classified as near threatened by IUCN; and their main threats are decreasing breeding success, predation, human development, and pollution from to the soda lakes the birds rely on. #flamingos  #PhotoArk",1

When you look up the Greek roots of the world “photography” its meaning translates close to “painting with light”.

Up close to the dominant male of the infamous, buffalo-hunting Tsaro Pride in Duba Plains in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Recently the pride has largely changed their go-to prey to the thriving population of red lechwe. The numbers of these swamp-living antelope have increased enormously in the last decade since hunting ended here. It's good news for these big cats because the buffalo move seasonally (and are a much more dangerous prey). But the smaller size of these antelope means that the lions need to hunt more often. This is a good time of year for the pride to hunt lechwe. The males are fighting and the sharp clash of horns alerts the cats to the location of those individuals who are preoccupied and not on the lookout for predators. Dominant male lions (being male lions), will take advantage of the lionesses kills where possible rather than expend their energy hunting for themselves. How do they know when a kill happens?

In an evening of February, those teepees looked like a movie set from Hollywood. At the motel, I was welcomed by the owners, an Indian couple from Gujarat, with a cup of masala milk tea and some Indian snacks.

As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as ""the most alien-looking place on Earth”. The Dragon Blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) has a unique and strange appearance, with an ""upturned, densely packed crown"". This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as ""dragon's blood"". The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock. One of the species' greatest threats is the gradual dessication of the archipelago.

Coming from ponies taken to Iceland by Norse settlers in the 9th and 10th centuries, the Icelandic horse is mentioned in literature and historical records throughout Icelandic history. Centuries of selective breeding developed the breed into its current form. The equine ancestors of the breed were likely brought to the island by Viking Age Scandinavians between 860 and 935 AD. The earliest Norse people venerated the horse as a symbol of fertility, with white horses holding a particularly special place in belief, often being offered as sacrifice at certain feasts and ceremonies. Horses also played a significant role in Norse mythology, several horses playing major roles in the Norse myths.

Karymsky (Russian: Карымская) is a stratovolcano and lake on the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, here photographed in winter, with the crater lake beyond. Karymsky is the most active volcano in the region and has been erupting continuously since a powerful earthquake struck the region in January 1996. The initial eruptions projected an estimated 30-40 million tons of pyroclastic material, saturated with acidic fluids, into the air, turning the nearby freshwater lake into a toxic chemical soup and decimating its ecosystem. Scientists are monitoring the volcano closely and despite the ecological catastrophe, Karymsky Lake is slowly recovering to pre-1996 conditions.

While invasive species are usually not good news,  scientist think that the invasive fruit may be a boost for an aptly named subspecies called the indefatigable island tortoise (Chelonoidis porteri), which is considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 
It's easy to see why tortoises would prefer some invasive species over native ones. The native species of guava, (Psidium galapageium), tends to produce small fruit that has thick skin, large seeds, and bitter pulp. On the other hand, the invasive species of guava, (P. guajava), has been cultivated around the world. As a result, the tree produces dense clusters of large, juicy, thin-skinned fruits that the tortoises love to eat. And furthermore it’s also a matter of availability. 
Because tortoises distribute seeds through their dung, the animals contribute to the increase of invasive guava on the islands. While a forest full of invasive plants may be good for the Galápagos tortoise in the short-term, the effects these species have on the ecosystem at large is still a mystery.

A large tiger shark with two hooks in its mouth swims over a shallow water sand flats in the northern Bahamas. Tiger sharks are an apex predator species in tropical waters though much of their lives have remained a mystery until recently. Researchers are now learning about behaviors and migratory patterns that are beginning to fill in the puzzle of their life cycle. Despite being large predators, life in the ocean is difficult and they face many challenges to survive. And as with all species, the tiger shark faces declining populations worldwide as the demand for shark fins continues. Having photographed sharks in locations worldwide, it is quite common these days to see sharks with hooks.

“All my community was destroyed” said Adham Lambo, a Syrian refugee currently living in the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. Moria camp overflows with refugees and their desperation. Inhuman living conditions and a snail-paced relocation process can drive the already traumatized towards depression and suicide - mental health issues that haunt a people with no home. They thought they had escaped the trauma of war & would find peace in Europe, however the camp become their new source of trauma. Lambo lives in fear of the violence and stress which plague life in the camp. “I spend all my time outside the camp. I go to the sea at 11am and come back 10 at night.”

Smoke was rising from the earth and the ground was still hot to the touch. There was no color, just black and grey. The scene suggested the snake had slithered as fast as possible to make it to the river, but that the burns to over half its body overwhelmed it, and the beautiful creature died just a few feet from safety.

Religion: Nuyagi Keetoowah Society
Ray Evans Harrell: I grew up in the O-Gah-Pah Nation in the current state of Oklahoma.  Indian religions were banned in 1883, so I grew up in the Indian Baptist community of Picher, Oklahoma, directed music in churches and ended up studying in New York.  In 1978 President Jimmy Carter signed the Freedom of Religion Act for American Indians and so for the first time we were able to ""come out"", so to speak. We started having prayer circles on a roof down on White street in Manhattan.

I became the apprentice to a Cherokee Medicine Priest and am now the Priest for the Nuyagi Keetoowah Society. Our job is to uphold and bring back the knowledge of our culture. We obviously are not farmers and hunters, we are urban people, I am an opera singer, we're developing something in the present to live in this tradition.

Our worship is meant to acquaint you with how to sense the environment in non-visual ways because one is  really tied to whether something exists, by whether they can see it. Our religion is holistic in that it involves all seven senses. 
We meet at a Stomp ground and light three fires. We build a cornmeal circle and there are seven directions that we include because they represent the front, the back, the left, the right, the up, the down, the center. And then the eighth direction is to the universe. We call it a Medicine Wheel.

It symbolizes that individually we are inadequate, we are limited. But when we put the circle together we can conceive of the whole of the reality, discover a greater truth for ourselves. 
Our message is that you are responsible for yourself and nobody escapes responsibility for what they do. The world is your teacher and you are to understand that you are a part of the Creator. 
Everything is a part of everything.

But each telling also means exposing painful scars, literal and metaphorical. I photographed Silvana at that axis of strength and depletion, as she sought out the grounding weight of her grandson’s small body, and offered him the soft foundation of her own. These are questions everywhere: whose stories we choose to believe, what weight we give a woman’s words against a man’s, whether women have exclusive jurisdiction over our own bodies. It is simultaneously dignifying and terrifying for women to tell the secrets more-powerful men demand we keep, and it’s never felt so important to listen, to believe, and to acknowledge the personal courage and integrity of the women who share their stories with us. “I feel light,” Silvana said after our interview ended. “Like I was carrying something really heavy and I put it down.” #believewomen  #women  #sexualassault  #colombia",0

But in the past decade, many have abandoned their farms for at least part of the year to work in cities abroad.

After a quarantine period, she was combined with the other fox kits in care to form an adopted litter-- which helps youngsters learn the social and hunting skills they need to survive in the wild after their release. Red foxes are born almost completely black and are therefore often mistaken for domestic puppies, raccoons, or even skunks! This species has a keen sense of vision, smell, and hearing. Their vertical pupils help them see well in the dark (like a cat) and it's said that they can hear prey moving under the snow up to 40 yards away! Red foxes are found throughout the United States and populations are considered stable, with a listing of least concern on the IUCN Red List. They adapt readily to green spaces in cities, particularly in large parks, on golf courses, and highways where they provide a valuable service to their human neighbors-- rodent control.  Although this species has a stable population, other fox species are at risk due to human encroachment on territory and human-introduced diseases such as canine distemper. Nebraska Wildlife Rehab receives more than a dozen orphaned red fox kits every year for rehabilitation, as well as several adult foxes that are injured or suffering from sarcoptic mange. Although these foxes take a lot of resources to rehabilitate, they are resilient, and are often some of the best success stories for this facility!

His son, Lenny, also has a passion for climbing and his daughter, Juliette, for hip-hop dance.Every Wednesday, he has his day off from work, and so he spends the whole day with his children. “During the summer, on hot days like today, we love to take our skateboards and ride from home to this canal, then jump into the water to cool off,” he says. /// FATHERS: I’m recently turned 40 and almost every friend around me has become a parent over the last few years. A couple of friends and I are the only ones in our group who still don’t have kids of our own. I naturally began to observe how the others were raising their children. I watch them playing together, hear the arguments and the kids’ complaints at mealtimes or at bedtime. I’ve often been the one in charge of the kids when those moments happen. Just maybe, all of these things are making me start to want to be a father. That is why I’ve decided to make the relationships between fathers and their children the focus of this photo project. Wherever I am in the world, when I meet a father I ask him to tell me about a special moment he has spent with his children and, when I can, I photograph them together /// Follow me for more stories @gabrielegalimbertiphoto #father  #fishing  #fathers  #dad  #dads  #vevey  #switzerland  #skateboarding  #river",0

It has been described as """"the most alien-looking place on Earth”. In the Dragon's Blood tree Forest at Diksam. An hour long exposure. The Dragon Blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari) has a unique and strange appearance, with an """"upturned, densely packed crown"""". This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as """"dragon's blood"""". The trees have long been harvested for their resin, highly prized in the ancient world and still used today. Socotrans use it ornamentally as well as for dying wool, as a glue, and a breath freshener. Because of the belief that it is the blood of the dragon it is also used in ritual magic and alchemy. Human activities have greatly reduced the tree's population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to livestock. One of the species' greatest threats is the gradual dessication of the archipelago.

Many people envision working in the studio as a high-energy, creative experience with me shouting “beautiful baby, beautiful” and the dogs responding with pose after pose like models before the lens of the famous fashion photographer and international spy, Austin Powers.

The reality is, I’m somewhat unable to speak when making photographs. It’s a genetic flaw or some right brain/left brain quirk realized when I was rejected from my childhood garage band for not being able to sing and play drums at the same time. Damn you Phil Collins.

When we work, this leaves me with a limited menu of grunting noises and the occasional guttural outburst, which I still find helpful in getting an animals attention. It also passes for a kind of barbaric shorthand between my wife Callie and I, until she tires of it and gets mad at me, which she finds helpful in getting my attention.

Zorro is a 12 year-old Standard Poodle, too smart to get in the middle of our bickering. He tried to stay neutral but always sided with Callie. This is often the case with the nice lady holding food and I learn to live with rejection.

This is more frustrating because Zorro is a very special dog that lights up a room when he enters and I want a dog like that to like me.

More caregiver than therapy dog, Zorro has always been there for the people who needed him most, some at the end of their lives and some who would miss those people the most.

Our connection was fleeting and dramatic and came together when I was finally able to vocalize a sound that engaged Zorro. 
I was trying to say his name but it came out with a poor rationing of consonants to vowels; 
Shtwa -thwo-or-oht-za-moAlshs

This stopped Zorro, deeply engaged with Callie and a snack of some kind, He turned to me, tilted his head and then he gave me -The Eyes; the eyes that had comforted, the eyes that had gotten him out of trouble, the eyes that had earned him more than his fair share of mac and cheese.

And then, Zorro burped.

Beautiful baby, beautiful.

I’m posting her photograph to remember her and other young Haitian girls today on the International #DayoftheGirl . She was a student in a small local school. She told me she loved to read and that one day she hoped to be a nurse. I never saw her again after that visit but I think of her quite often because she so embodied the spirit and talent and the hopes and sense of possibility that all Haitians share and that is shared by young girls around the world.  I hope she accomplished her dreams. Like many developing nations, the literacy rate in Haiti is low and below the average for Latin American and Caribbean countries. Haiti faces shortages in educational supplies and qualified teachers where the rural population is less educated than the urban. A major earthquake in 2010 exacerbated an already difficult system by destroying infrastructure and displacing 50 to 90% of of students. Private education, which must be paid for, has substituted for education in public schools although the government has attempted initiatives to change this.  I tried very hard to help educate children in Haiti but the need was like a bottomless pit. In the world young women 15-29 are more than 3 times as likely as young men to not be in employment, education or training, according to UNICEF. Education can help change stereotypes we have held onto too long and take advantage of the talent and creative voices of girls to make a more vibrant and equitable world.  There are many organisations, ranging from public to private, that support and promote the education of girls around the world.  If you want to make the world a better place and safer for young women, please consider researching and supporting the education of girls and give them a voice.

This is what the Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma is for me. In my career I have covered everything from war to fashion and seen great suffering and violence. I have told stories about heroic figures and those who were beaten down by life. We photographers choose to be in places where we see suffering and glory and to bear witness. But these things impact us in unexpected ways including a kind of longing for normality or loneliness or missing home or feeling completely disconnected from the world. We don’t realize the toll it takes on us until we are forced to face it.

The Zayandeh River used to have significant flow throughout the year, unlike many of Iran's rivers which are seasonal, but today runs dry due to water extraction before reaching Isfahan. In the early 2010s, the lower reaches of the river dried out completely after successive dry-outs.

Men make war; women live with the consequences. At least that is the way it is largely perceived. Women are hardly passive victims though.

I made this photo from a helicopter using a telephoto lens. We were flying at around midnight during the summer in the arctic where daylight is continuous.

Lens-like, it pulls in in Muslims from Salah e-Din Street, Orthodox Jews from Mea She'arim, Christian pilgrims from the hostels on the old Green Line and even the odd National Geographic photographer and squeezes them through this narrow gap in Suleiman the Magnificent's walls. It's like one of those technical drawings of how a jet engine works: it intakes these believers, fires them through grand architecture and ejects them at high energy through the nozzle of El Wad St and down into the Old City and its holy sites. Except instead of thrust it's an engine for producing piety. I think it is the most exciting, jinking left-turn right-turn in History.

In Scotland the season runs from 01 October through 15 April each year. Much of the heather burning we see today takes place on grouse moors such as those here in the Cairngorm National Park, Scotland. Here for generations gamekeepers have burnt long narrow strips of mature heather on a rotation. How often depends on how quickly the heather becomes both woody and unpalatable, and tall and unavailable. After 2/3 years young heather plants will have regenerated from seed or old stools that survived the fire. If the temperature of the burning is too high, or the grazing pressures are high, the critical balance of growth and competition allows fire and grazing-resistant grass species to become dominant, and the heathland is replaced. By creating a patchwork of different aged heathers a gamekeeper aims to have some young heather for grouse, sheep, deer and mountain hares that is nutritionally richer. Patches are burnt every eight to thirty years.

The church, Amsterdam’s oldest, has had every inch of its windows covered with red, inactinic masking film. The colour has a strong symbolic value in art history (the colour of sin, the devil, temptation: we’re in the heart of Amsterdam’s Red Light District) and also in photography where the church feels like the world’s largest darkroom. The windows were for the first two hundred, Catholic, years of the church’s history wildly coloured and pictorial. These were smashed in the Protestant takeover called, rather menacingly, ‘Beeldenstorm’ (statue-storm), part of the Iconclastic Fury of 1566. Red has been absent from these cool, clean, whitewashed interiors ever since. It’s most odd to be suffused in light of such a narrow spectrum.

Liwonde National Park was recently on the verge of collapse just 3 years ago -the park was overrun with poaching and more wire snares existed in the park than large animals. But in 2015, @AfricanParksNetwork assumed management of the park on behalf of the Government, and immediately got to work training and outfitting their Ranger unit, preventing poaching, removing almost 30,000 snares, and making the park safe for nature's return. In 2017 they reintroduced cheetahs, and just as of August 16th, they reintroduced lions to restore this iconic species to the park, and help balance natural systems by bringing back critically needed predators. This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

100 years ago this month saw the beginning of the end of the First World War. 
From 8 August to 11 November 1918 the war entered its final phase during which the Allies (US, British, French... forces)  launched a series of offensives against the Germans on the Western Front.  The offensive essentially pushed the Germans out of France, forcing them to retreat beyond the Hindenburg Line, and was followed by an armistice and the collapse of the German Empire. There were over 1.8 million casualties on both sides.

I've been working for a year now on a larger project about the aftermath of the War. Here at Newfoundland Park on the Somme, the preserved trenches and shell holes are softened, but still preserved.

This adorable 12-week-old mink kit was found with its siblings when they were just a week old on a cold, rainy night in March when the den their mother had made in a piece of unused construction equipment was destroyed. An attempt to reunite the babies with their mother failed, so they were rescued by Nebraska Wildlife Rehab.  When they first came into care, their eyes were closed, they weighed just a few ounces, and had very little hair.  They had to be fed a specialized formula every two hours until they were stable, and then six times a day until they were weaned onto solid food. They are mischievous animals, which makes them a unique challenge to rehabilitate.  They are fast and love to climb and swim and require extremely specialized housing with a variety of habitats that includes pools and dens. They also must eat on a very regular schedule -- minks, like all weasels, have a high metabolism and aren't able to skip meals like other mammals.  At Nebraska Wildlife Rehab this species makes up a small part of the over 6,000 animals they care for each year, but their unique and challenging personalities always make them a staff and volunteer favorite!  American mink are a common animal near bodies of water throughout North America.  Being semi-aquatic carnivores, they prey on fish, small rodents, reptiles, amphibians and birds.

So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguars range. Also poaching for skins, bones and teeth is growing for the first time since the 1970’s to feed the demand for people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth”, Chinese Traditional Medicine and now Luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid

Since June I’ve made near weekly treks into swamps to visit blooming ghosts and service camera traps with precision laser triggers aiming close to blooms. The hope is to answer a mystery to science by capturing unprecedented photographs of a ghost orchid being pollinated. Notice the impressive length of the nectar spur — the thin tube extending from the back of the flower to the right in this photo. Check out @CarltonWard for a different view of this same flower. The giant sphinx moth is thought to be the only pollinator because it’s mouth parts are long enough to reach to the bottom of the nectar spur for the sweet reward that draws the moth deep enough into the flower to get pollen stuck on its head, or to share pollen already there from another ghost. Approximately 2000 ghost orchids exist in the wild, of which one in ten bloom each year and perhaps one in ten of those get pollinated — their only natural means of reproducing. It’s fair to say I’ve become obsessed with these ghosts — their mystery and the magic of the swamps where they survive. For three summers I’ve been drawn deep into the orchids’ watery world and it takes the blooming season ending for me to move on to other work. Meanwhile my friend @macstonephoto is on a parallel quest to document pollination at @corkscrewswamp and his subject still has 5 active blooms.

A green sea turtle swims among a school of surgeonfish in the Southern Line Islands, located in the central Pacific Ocean. Because of their remoteness, these islands and the waters surrounding them remain largely unspoiled and diving the reefs here is like traveling back in time.

Researchers studying coral ecosystems have discovered that a pristine reef has a biomass that is comprised largely of predators, including sharks, snapper and groupers. Sadly, many reef systems around the world today do not have these animals, as they have been fished to dangerously low levels. Every animal plays a vital role in the health of an ecosystem and when individual species are removed, the entire environment breaks down. A healthy ocean is needed for a vibrant planet.

This brilliantly colored insect is a critically endangered American burying beetle. This species is an important recycler of nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems! By burying and eating carrion (dead animal flesh) they remove a source of food from flies, which are often pests and health threats. They also feed on fly eggs and larvae, helping to reduce their numbers. The precarious state of the population of American burying beetles was recognized in 1989 when the species was listed as Endangered on the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Endangered Species List.  Reasons for their decline are unknown, but evidence points to habitat loss and fragmentation. Another theory is that this animal thrived by feeding on the now-extinct passenger pigeon, one of the most abundant birds the world had every seen. When they wet extinct, the beetle declined severely. Thankfully, the @stlzoo where this beetle was photographed is committed to working with conservation organizations to assist with declining populations of native plants and animals. The center has successfully bred thousands of American burying beetles on the Zoo campus and, along with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the Missouri Department of Conservation and The Nature Conservancy, the Zoo is reintroducing captive-raised beetles to Southwest Missouri. #Photoark  #americanburyingbeetle  #criticallyendangeredspecies",0

Radiated tortoises have widely been considered the most beautiful tortoise in the world.

Major causes of decline include habitat destruction for agriculture, horticulture, and charcoal production. Adults are poached for the bushmeat trade, while juveniles are collected illegally for the pet trade by the thousands. Widespread corruption and lack of enforcement under weak governmental control, along with extreme poverty are causing poaching to increase. The @turtleconservancy, where these tortoises were photographed, have partnered with several organizations and zoos to help fight animal trafficking in Madagascar and Asia, identifying trade routes, poachers, and buyers. In April of 2018, more than 10,000 young radiated tortoises were found in a house in Toliara, Madagascar. These animals were sick and held for months without food or water.

Mexican honeypot ants are named for the incredible way they store resources. These ants are like tiny refrigerators, stashing food for the whole colony in anticipation of dry seasons. Designated worker ants called “repletes” hang from the ceiling of their nest, while foraging workers bring them nectar and juices from insect prey-- which is edible with a sweet and tangy flavor. Their abdomens slowly become spherical and transparent as they swell with sugary liquids. They can reach the size of a small grape— some become so large that they cannot leave the nest! All of this work insures that the whole colony can eat even when food is not readily available. These little ants are so full of nutrients that they are often eaten by other animals— even humans. This is one of over 100 species of honeypot ant found in warm arid regions around the world. This species occurs in the southwestern US and northern Mexico, where they feed primarily on nectar and small insects. #honeypotant  #PhotoArk",1

Child labor is defined as work carried out to the detriment and endangerment of a child, in violation of international law and national legislation. It either deprives children of schooling or requires them to assume the dual burden of schooling and work.

Child labor forbidden by law falls into three categories:
1.  Slavery, trafficking, debt bondage and forced labor, forced recruitment for armed conflict, prostitution and pornography, and illicit activities.
2. Labor performed by a child under the minimum age specified for that work. 
3. Labor that jeopardizes the physical, mental or moral well-being of a child.

This little mechanic in the country of Benin works punishing hours in hazardous conditions without pay. Thousands of children in West Africa end up in slavery, in the abuse of an old tradition of sending village children to the cities to live with relatives and work as domestics in exchange for an education. But it has become a professional trafficking operation, with children kidnapped or sold by destitute parents and ending up as unpaid workers in homes, factories and construction sites.

Debbie Banks, Environmental Investigation Agency UK, Tiger Campaign Director says: “At a single stroke, China has shattered its reputation as a growing leader in conservation following its domestic ban on the sale of ivory at the start of the year. It is instead revealed as a sham, its international image in tatters and its credibility destroyed—and all for the sake of deeply questionable business sectors which serve only to drive consumer demand for the parts and products of endangered species. History will not judge the Government of China kindly or with respect for such a reactionary, ill-judged and damaging decision.”
China’s action stands in sharp contrast to the country’s moves to combat poaching in recent years. The country has had a 25-year-old ban in place preventing the import or export of these products. And the World Federation of Chinese Medicine Societies—the official group that dictates what can be used in traditional medicine—also removed rhino horn and tiger bone from its list of products approved for use on patients (though the market still existed for them).

That’s just like Marlie apparently, who since her “passing” gets along just fine without a spleen and still maintains a well-earned reputation as a Ditch-Dog-Diva, according to those closest to her.

Like the shock of white on her belly, she has an obstinate streak that comes from something in her lineage, a checkering of brave and intelligent breeds that when assembled in close proximity produce the defiant sort you see here.

If I might talk about me for a second, one of the absolute minimal requirements of this whole #yearofthedogs  business is that a dog should remain in front of the camera long enough for me to push the button on said device.

Few dogs have tested my patience as Marlie did.

Some have been killed by rival packs, some killed by human hunters and one was taken stolen by a rival pack. One of the most amazing aspects of Mr. Blue’s character is that he has this ability to mingle his way into existing wolf packs. He must have that perfect personality mix of non-threatening, submissive behavior and perhaps it's his age shows in the color of his fur.

It is the beginning of adulthood, a rite of passage and a turning point. For numerous workers, only 30 years ago, the first job was often the only one, as people could remained in the same company for a lifetime, just being gradually promoted or slightly changing ones positions with seniority. In today’s scenario all is temporary, as the dream of a life position has forever vanished. Usually the first job is the first of a long list that will follow. In the wake of the worst economic crises in modern history, where for many young adults there seemed to be actually no possibility for a first job at all, I explore the world of employment of today’s youth. This is a project that will be carried out in all the 5 continents where the global theme does not obscure, but actually heightens the local specificities.

At the age of 16, she went to study for a year in the USA, with an exchange program. She loved being abroad and, a few months after her return to China, she decided to apply to an American university. She ended up studying business at Ohio State University. Two years ago, she graduated and came back to Beijing.More than business, her greatest passion is art, so she started to look for a job related to that field. Thanks to a friend, she got in touch with the “Three Shadows Gallery”, the most important photography gallery in the city. “They were looking for a person with international experience. I applied for the job and I got it. Now I work as a curator for the gallery”. She organizes events, shows and workshops and handles all the relationships with the artists.

Khan emigrated to Astoria, Queens in New York when he was around 4, with his freedom fighter father seeking political asylum in America. Among South Asians, Bangladeshi immigrants are one of the newest and fastest growing immigrant groups in the United States, with nearly half of all Bangladeshi immigrants in this country. Residing in the New York metropolitan area. A major chunk is in the Queens borough. Queens artist Anik was inspired from the music he’d heard in his neighborhood and the spoken-word (kobita) his father would perform at family gatherings. Anik has become a vocal advocate of immigrant pride in his music. His lyrics are often about his dual identities as a Bangladeshi immigrant and a kid from Queens who often describes himself as “curry chicken meets collard greens”. He just released a new single, ""Big Fax."" The opening line of the song goes: ""Damn… It Feels Good To Be An Immigrant."" From belonging to a family seeking political asylum in America, to today becoming a face of the American dream, Anik Khan has come a long way. He thinks it's about time that we flipped the script on outdated immigrant stereotypes.

I did not know about Anik’s music before I moved to America. One of my friends from Boston brought his name up while I was researching my south Asian American project. In my first meeting with Anik I found him very amicable and his ability for spoken poetry stands out from a general conversation with him. We started speaking in Bengali right away. Often times it is a confusing to talk to a Bengali-American: Shall we start in Bengali or English? I think many of south Asians could relate to this confusion.",0

Roughly 12,000 Native children attended, many of whom were taken from their families and communities by force in the name of coercive assimilation. This cemetery near where the school once stood is home to the graves of 184 students.

Mr. Sam has spent the past 30 years working to help identify and repatriate the remains of children who died while at boarding schools across the country.

More than 4,000 elephants, which was 95% of the population, were slaughtered between 2002 to 2010 for the sale of their ivory – and poachers wreaked havoc on both the wildlife and people who lived there. By 2010, only 450 elephants remained. That same year, @africanparksnetwork signed a long-term agreement with the government of Chad to fully manage Zakouma and change the trajectory of the park. They built a ranger team and implemented effective law enforcement measures and community networks, and today poaching has been practically eliminated. The elephant population is finally on the rise for the first time in a decade. Elephants have surpassed 550 individuals, and not one has been lost to poaching since January 2016.  Last year @africanparksnetwork counted 81 elephant calves under the age of three years old; in 2011 they counted one. Without the support of local communities this would not work. The park is the largest employer in the region; thousands of people are getting an education and healthcare, and decency and civility, along with life, have found their back to this once forgotten place.

Here, Sudan, the last living male Northern White Rhino left on this planet is comforted moments before he passed away March 19, 2018 in northern Kenya. Sudan was brought to Kenya from @safari_park_dvur_kralove in the #Czechrepublic  in 2009. He died surrounded by people who loved him at @olpejeta and has been an inspirational figure for many across the world. If there is any meaning in his death, its that Sudan can be our final wake up call. In a world of 7 billion, we need to start recognizing that we are not separate from nature. When we see ourselves as part of the landscape and part of nature, then saving nature is really about saving ourselves.

Today, fewer 30,000 rhinos and 3,900 tigers remain in the wild. We are witnessing extinction on our watch and must help them by speaking out and supporting conservation efforts worldwide, especially among the indigenous communities who are on the front lines every day against poaching.

Nine years ago, together with @dereckjoubert, and National Geographic, we set up the Big Cats Initiative as a long-term effort to halt the declineof big cats in the wild. The initiative supports efforts to save big cats through assessment, on-the-ground conservation, education, and global public-awareness campaigns.

Both the magazine designer and I wanted this to be the lead picture but it lost out to another image of mine featuring hunters in a vast central Montana field rehabbed by the conservation group @pheasants_forever.  The beauty of the pheasant is apparent in even in death although the brilliance of its coloration I believe lessens in death.  When I was assigned to do the photography for this essay I really thought it would be popular with readers. I feared the recoil by those who might find killing a deer, such a graceful and docile animal, very distasteful if displayed in the magazine.  I could not have been more wrong.  The story ""Hunters"" received more mail than any other story published that year and response by readers was six to one positive.  I  believe the reason was very much influenced by the information given in the article about how hunting is part of the overall effort of conservation and managing wildlife in our country; from license fees wildlife refuges are helped to benefit bird watchers and those who simply enjoy the many areas set aside for wildlife habitat.

Colombia. The paramilitaries played music as they carried out the massacres in El Salado. Today students in a band drown out those memories. A teacher visits once a week to instruct the musicians, who range in age from seven to 23 and practice in a local park.

Once a prosperous tobacco farming town, was the scene of Colombia's deadliest massacre. The killing of El Salado lasted six days from February 16 to 21 of 2000. By the end there 66 people killed and the remaining 4,000 residents fled, joining more than 2 million other internally displaced Colombians at the time. 
With the efforts of its leaders, the residents returned despite the presence of FARC. Today El Salado and it's residents are transforming their grim past.

In this photo, third generation Apalachicola Kendall oysterman Schoelles tongs for oysters in St Vincent Sound where one million acres of contiguous protected land extend north from the coast, providing crucial wildlife habitat while helping ensure the health of the estuary downstream. Oysters filter the bay to clean the water. In that way, Kendall and oyster men and women like him are protecting the Gulf for all of us, especially as they plant new oyster beds that also help buffer the coast against storms. I trust Kendall has weathered this hurricane. He and his family have weathered storms on the Gulf for more than a century. Hopefully he will be tonging for oysters and caring for the bay again soon. Maybe there will be a silver lining and the hurricane will have dissipated the red tide that has been plaguing the Gulf this summer, arguably exacerbated by pollution from millions of coastal residence who don't live in balance with the ecosystem the way Kendall does. But the Gulf is resilient and balance and sustainability are possible if we all pay attention and do our part.

Fresh back from Afghanistan, with time to reflect on previous trips... more from my work for the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) - here, a photograph of the restored Babur's Garden, nestled in the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains and the fertile alluvial plains of the Kabul River basin. The garden is named after  a young Uzbek Prince, Zahir-ud-Din Muhammad (“Defender of the Faith”; commonly known by his nickname “Babur”) who captured  Kabul in 1504 at the age of 21. Babur's garden is divided into stepped terraces of sixteen levels, and his grave is located near the top of the site. The garden represents an oasis of tranquility surrounded by informal residential development; native species of fruit trees and flowers have been planted in the restored garden.

This male jag is looking for caiman for her dinner—while a female waits on the bank. Shot in August in the Pantanal of Brazil.

Our animal family is so much like us: They find mates, they have kids, they have to feed themselves and their families. If we can find a way to believe they think, feel, and have emotions, we will all be better humans. We need to treat them better and find a way to ensure their future on this planet. They are keystone species in their ecosystems, though we as humans are not.

Jaguars are the third largest of the big cats. They are found from the U.S./Mexico border to northern Argentina. Jaguars have rebounded in Brazil's Patanal, where 95% of the land is privately owned. In the past many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle. Today in this area tourism brings in much more money to the local economy than cattle ranching. So the jaguar population is increasing. But revenge killings of jaguars happen close to this area and all throughout the jaguar's range. Poaching for skins, bones, and teeth is also growing for the first time since the 1970s to feed the demand of people who think they receive the “power of the jaguar through their teeth,” Chinese traditional medicine, and now luxury items from endangered species. “When the buying stops, the killing can too.” @wildaid 
My first story with big cats was the first @natgeo jaguar story 20 years ago! It has changed my life working with the magical and magnificent cats of the world. Animals have emotions just like we have.

I was, I’ll admit, pretty lost. What at first was a slightly nervous moment as this warrior simply came and sat next to me, has over the years developed into a deep respect both for the man and his work with @ewasolions in the Samburu, northern Kenya. The African lion population has declined by 43% in the last 20 years and lions now occupy only 8% of their historical range in Africa. The estimated numbers of lions across Africa are approximately 20,000. In Kenya, the national population now numbers less than 2,000 individuals. At current rates of decline, the species could become extinct here within the next two decades. This reduction in lion numbers is primarily due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, typically when lions kill people’s livestock. Lions and other large carnivores are wide-ranging species, and designated protected areas are often not large enough to ensure their long-term survival. It is crucial, therefore, that conservation of these species, as well as their prey, is addressed throughout the landscape, which not only incorporates protected areas, but also the surrounding areas where local people live. @ewasolions is dedicated to conserving lions and other large carnivores by promoting co-existence between people and wildlife, they work hand-in-hand with local communities to provide education, training and improved conservation practices that help people and wildlife, using sound science to help guide the long-term conservation of lions across community conservancies and protected areas in northern Kenya, and I love their work 👍🏿👍🏼💚to see more of it, follow me here @chancellordavid @thephotosociety @natgeo @everydayextinction @ewasolions #conserving  #conservation  #carnevores  #northernkenya  #kenya",0

Capturing lions in South Africa to move to Liwonde National Park in Malawi for  @AfricanParksNetwork.
Just as of last week, lions are roaring in Liwonde National Park in Malawi after decades of being extinct thanks to the work of @AfricanParksNetwork , the Malawian Government, @LionRecovery , @leonardodicapriofdn and @leonardodicaprio .
Liwonde National Park was recently on the verge of collapse just 3 years ago -the park was overrun with poaching and more wire snares existed in the park than large animals. But in 2015, @AfricanParksNetwork assumed management of the park on behalf of the Government, and immediately got to work training and outfitting their Ranger unit, preventing poaching, removing almost 30,000 snares, and making the park safe for nature's return. In 2017 they reintroduced cheetahs, and just as of August 16th, they reintroduced lions to restore this iconic species to the park, and help balance natural systems by bringing back critically needed predators. This population is expected to triple in the next few years - and will be supplemented with individuals from other parks African Parks manages in Malawi to ensure for a healthy genepool - as well as help with tourism to the park, benefiting the surrounding local communities. There are fewer than 20,000 lions left in Africa, down from 200,000 just 100 years ago - and their long-term future remains in question: they are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, lack of prey, unsustainable hunting and now poaching for their skins, bones, claws and other body parts. But projects like these show how with determination, political will, community support, and simply envisioning a better future, we can bring this species back as well as protect our last wild landscapes, benefiting both wildlife and people, and creating a better existence for all.

But her most regular dream is of eating a meal with her mother and sister in their Myanmar village. What food do you like? “I don’t feel hungry.” Ever? “If I feel very hungry I have a little rice.” Why don’t you enjoy eating? “When I think of my parents I don’t feel good eating.” Do you think about them often? “Yes. I do. With every breath I take.”

One of life’s greatest misconceptions is a simple fable. That time is a healer. One year ago this week “ethnic cleansing” perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya sparked a massive refugee crisis. Nearly a million Rohingya – those who escaped the flames and executions – are now living in camps in Bangladesh. Many of them were raped, most saw loved ones killed, thousands arrived wounded. All are traumatized. Here, in this impoverished monsoon soaked corner of Bangladesh, is one of the most densely populated areas of PTSD affected and depressed people on earth.
//
Johura was semi-conscious much of the journey from Myanmar to Bangladesh. She had lost a lot of blood from a bullet that struck her hip. Fortune briefly shone on her during this nightmare. From the shoulder of the man carrying her she shook awake to see a group of boys - one of them her 10-year-old brother - her only surviving sibling. And there is her light - the glimmer of hope in which she might find peace. Neither food, nor friends, nor playing, nor pretty dresses make her happy. How about you brother, does your brother make you happy? “If my brother is happy, that can make me happy - in here, he is the only one who can.”

My English Springer Spaniel Buster scans the Montana fields as we look for grouse or pheasants. In the fall of 2004 Buster and I had driven from our home in Virginia to Montana where we stayed with some of my Hutterite friends at their colony near Stanford, Montana. Buster loved to hunt and it was so good to see him running through the tall reeds and grasses along the creek bottoms, snuffling and snorting, seeking the scent of pheasants that might eventually flush, giving him the chance to leap in a futile attempt to snatch their lengthy tail feathers. Even when he grew old Buster would still tremble at the thought of getting out to hunt. He lived to be thirteen and was a great example of the old saying that the only fault dogs have is that they don't live long enough.

Thanks to strict protection under the Endangered Species Act numbers of the iconic bears have recovered since then from near extinction to more than 700 individuals. This recovery, however, led to Trump administration to de-list the species from federal protection resulting in Wyoming and Idaho to issue trophy hunting licenses for as many as 23 bears.
Just two days before the sports hunt of grizzlies in the area would have started this fall, federal judge Dana Christensen ordered that the grizzly bears kept their protection status.
Less than 2,000 grizzlies call the Lower 48 states their home today, compared to more than 100,000 in historical times. Let give the surviving bears some space. Their habitat has been strongly fragmented, so the remaining bears are distributed over several island populations. 
Bears are facing increased pressure from the effects of climate change, like the loss of important food sources like whitebark pine seeds. It is essential to continue to work on restoring bear habitat, creating wildlife corridors and reconnecting the Yellowstone bears with the other populations of the Lower 48. That would allow for a true biological recovery so that those powerful animals to continue to roam the heart of the Rocky Mountains.",1

Spinner dolphins socializing in the early morning off Hawaii. Spinners are one of the most social of dolphin species, rarely seen alone and typically found in larger pods. They forage at night offshore in deep water, then come into shallow bays in the morning to socialize and rest. The Hawaiian spinners have a beautiful tri-coloration.

A couple of friends and I are the only ones in our group who still don’t have kids of our own. I naturally began to observe how the others were raising their children. I watch them playing together, hear the arguments and the kids’ complaints at mealtimes or at bedtime. I’ve often been the one in charge of the kids when those moments happen. Just maybe, all of these things are making me start to want to be a father. That is why I’ve decided to make the relationships between fathers and their children the focus of this photo project. Wherever I am in the world, when I meet a father I ask him to tell me about a special moment he has spent with his children and, when I can, I photograph them together /// Follow me for more stories @gabrielegalimbertiphoto #father  #fathers  #dad  #dads  #italy  #firenze  #florence  #music  #musictherapy",0

Socotra is a small island in the Indian Ocean that is part of Yemen.

It has been till recently a Yemeni military base, were access was very restricted, and this has contributed to preserve it from any kind of mass tourism.

The hundreds of ivory tubes are pre-cut “hankos,” a highly desirable personal stamp in Japan. Ivory in Japan plays out in musical instruments, hankos and netsuke, small ivory carvings. On more than one occasions I was offered ivory that it is illegal to export. Online, Yahoo! Japan offers illegal ivory for sale immediately accessible to a consumer market. In a recent environmental investigation, I worked with National Geographic writer Rachel Nuwer to examine Japan’s decision to continue with its domestic ivory market, despite China closing theirs in January 2018. This makes Japan the largest legal ivory market in the world. They have taken an attitude similar to their stance on whaling, placing a sense of nationalistic pride ahead of the lives of #elephants , some of the most sentient and #endangered  animals on the planet. Japan has consumed ivory from at least 262,500 elephants since 1970, the vast majority from large, mature adults, according to Allan Thornton, president of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). Japan’s ivory industry today, Thornton adds, is “greater than any other nation on Earth.” While China had some 170 ivory outlets nationwide prior to its ban, Japan has 8,200 retailers, 300 manufacturers, and 500 wholesalers. “In the 1980s Japan was so notorious, not only in terms of the volume of ivory it consumed but also for illegal trade,” says Isao Sakaguchi, a professor of international relations and global environmental governance at Gakushuin University, in Tokyo. “Japan was responsible for the near extinction of African elephants in most of their range states.” Legal trade in ivory inevitably creates loopholes for illegal trade and #Japan  has loopholes you can drive a ship through. National Geographic writer Rachel Nuwer has done a superb job of reporting on the implications of Japan’s decision to continue with their ivory trade. I would urge anyone who cares about animals to read this illuminating feature on @natgeo online. #illegalivory   @eiaenvironment #ivorytrade  #endangeredanimals  #japanivory  #liveforthestory",0

This gently portrait of an Amish boy holding his pet guinea pig started my career as a professional photographer and my 50 years as a contributor to National Geographic Magazine.

In the spring of 1964, I was blessed with getting a photographic internship at National Geographic in Washington D.C. after showing my portfolio of work to Robert E. Gilka, the legendary director of photography at National Geographic. As my first assignment as an intern, Gilka sent me to Lancaster County, PA to cover a Pennsylvania Dutch festival. """"Try to get some pictures of the Amish, if you can,"""" he told me. It seemed the magazine had a finished manuscript about the Amish but had no pictures. He didn't tell he'd earlier sent a staff photographer to Pennsylvania who'd come back with nothing. Although I photographed the festival events my success with the Amish came through driving the country roads, introducing myself to Amish farmers, many of whom turned me down but eventually finding one who allowed me to photograph his family and their way of life.  My first assignment which was to have been for a weekend or perhaps a week, lasted through much of the summer and into the fall of 1964.  On an overcast afternoon, after photographing an Amish farmer working in his fields I was brought to the barn by his son so he could show me his pet guinea pig.  My portrait of the boy and his pet became the lead picture in my essay on the Amish of Lancaster county published in the August, 1965 issue, a story which has been credited as the beginning of a new, more intimate look at people in the National Geographic Magazine.

As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life isn't found anywhere else on Earth.  In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 endemic species; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more.

Fluid, that’s how Aart Aarsbergen @aart_natgeo (former Editor-in-Chief of the Dutch edition of National Geographic Magazine poetically described Rottumeroog; a place continuously shaped by the elements. I still remember the phone call after my first visit to this island in the Wadden Sea. I told Aart I truly loved the place, after which he asked me what was there to see. ‘“Nothing”, I replied. Which as a magazine editor made him a little nervous.

Aart, last week you officially retired after 17 years @natgeonl. I’m extremely grateful for the chances, faith, confidence and freedom you gave me over the past years, which allowed me to grow into the photographer I am today. I wish you all the best and I sincerely hope our paths will keep crossing in the future. Perhaps not professionally (as I’m not thinking about retirement any time soon) but I’ll be on the lookout for a cyclist making fun of my non-Italian bicycle ;-).

In the end, they chose the center—generally considered a more pleasant venue, despite being next to a minefield. After signing their marriage certificate, the bride and groom bowed to their parents. “Now that you are married to each other, don’t forget to call your parents,” said the registrar who married them, “and come to visit them.” That simple advice to the newlyweds, the kind that most newlyweds elsewhere may receive, was also a reminder that in these front-line areas of a war that has simmered for years, many young people leave for safer places while their parents stay behind.

It has been more than four years since the war in Ukraine began. The front line is static and life around it is pretty normal—or so it seems. People in conflict zones get used to danger. Like everywhere else, they work, cook, have fun, fall in love, get married and raise children.

When I woke, I collected my children and escaped.” Pushing through the pain of the rape and the loss of her husband Tayeba trekked through sucking mud and monsoon-swollen rivers towards Bangladesh.

Orangutans are the last great apes that survive in Asia. They live only on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, and they are endangered due to the massive destruction of their forest habitat. Nearly half of all orangutans, a staggering 150,000 in all, vanished from Borneo during the last 15 years according to a recent study. Orangutans are also victims of the illegal pet trade—babies are captured by poachers who often kill their mothers to reach them. It is imperative that we protect the forests orangutans depend on to insure that our relatives on the family tree of life will be with us beyond our own lifetime. In recognition of @WorldOrangutanDay on August 19 I welcome you to support the organizations that are in the front lines of protecting orangutans through public activities and through covert actions aimed at busting wildlife criminals. @Freelandfoundation @World_Wildlife and @WildAid need your help.

I just returned from a trip to Switzerland with Klaus Thymann of @projectpressure to photograph the Rhône Glacier in southern Switzerland, which is disappearing at a colossal rate. 
Because there is a small shop there that carves an ice grotto into the glacier and charges tourists to experience inside the blue ice, it has been worth their money attempting to slow the glacier’s retreat. They have invested heavily in a special thermal blanket that has kept about 25m (82ft, in depth) of ice from disappearing, and has kept the ice grotto intact. However, after a few harsh winters on the mountain, the blanket is starting to disintegrate. And unfortunately the method is not scaleable: we cannot do this to all the world’s ice; the gesture is as forlorn and doomed as the glacier itself. So with heavy lament, this glacier, which has existed for millennia, will die within the lifetime of children born today.

But she did not stop there. After resting for a while, she sat up, took a look around, and invited the cubs to nurse. She fell into a kind of trancelike state, letting her head slowly sink down in exhaustion as her cubs drank. I can still clearly hear the suckling sounds in my mind and even noticed a purring from the cubs. It was an unforgettable sight: mother and cubs, nestled together on the ice in the warm late-evening light, with drifting sea ice leading to the horizon where it meets the edge of the Austfonna ice cap in Svalbard.” In late August polar bears are hanging on to the last of the drifting sea ice. To successfully raise her cubs, this mother needs the sea ice platform to hunt for seals. 
I was in awe. This bear completely trusted us. After taking the first pictures of this scene, I remember how I quickly rushed to the bow of the boat. I was not happy with the earlier framing of the image.

Although he was attacked by Calusa Indians (and later died of his wounds in Havana), cattle and horses remained. When my ancestors migrated into Florida in the mid 1800s, cattle had been living wild in the Florida woods for nearly three centuries. Descendants of these original Spanish livestock are called """"cracker"""" cattle and horses today. Early American settlers of the Florida frontier were also called """"crackers"""", attributed to the """"crack"""" of their cow whips. Modern horses actually evolved in North America but vanished during the mass extinction of mammals 13,000 years ago, near the end of the last ice age, around the same time when the human population was expanding throughout the continent. Much of the southeastern US was adapted to grazers. There were herds of wild bison in Florida as recently as the 1700s (and perhaps later). There are places today, such as the grasslands and prairies of the Northern Everglades, where modern cattle serve a beneficial role in maintaining native ecosystems.

At this stage, he had walked all the way from Ethiopia. The next day, because of a mix up, Paul and I were arrested by the secret service. Here is an extract from Paul’s evocative text, from the September issue of @natgeo magazine:
""Early that morning, in a coarse ice mist, we set out with two pack donkeys to climb Irshad Pass. Climbing a mountain under such conditions is a strange and disorienting experience. It was like scaling a frozen and crazily tilted sea. We tottered along ice-rimed cliffs. Snow hid fatal crevices. Sometimes the donkeys fell through the crust and refused to get up. By midday a blizzard was in full gust.
“Hello, Arthur, can you do me a favour?” Paley was shouting into the satellite phone. We couldn’t see a hundred steps ahead, much less the peaks far above. Paley’s brother in Paris googled and read out to us the GPS coordinates for Irshad.
Irshad Pass rises to 16,335 feet above sea level. We finally reached it at sunset. Paley ventured a feeble victory dance. I gulped air so thin and metallic it cut my lungs like razor blades. Gales had scoured the summit to raw bedrock. Without shelter or firewood, it was a hazardous place to camp. But we had little choice.
Plainclothes Pakistani security forces confronted us the next night while we camped at the eastern end of the Hindu Kush. We had notified the government of our plan to enter Pakistan via Irshad. We carried valid visas issued in advance. But the officers, armed with AK-47s, insisted we had trespassed into a restricted zone. Overnight, they drove us to the frontier town of Gilgit. In detention there, I overheard Paley, curled on his cot, parroting in his emphatic Norman accent the lines from a film playing on his hidden mobile phone: “An eye for an eye only ends up making see whole world blind.” “Matthieu,” I whispered, “are you watching Gandhi in an intelligence agency safe house?”

Rabbi Shmuley Boteach: "" I was born Jewish and as I grew older, after my parents divorced, I increased my dedication to my faith and decided as a teenager to become a rabbi.

Judaism strongly believes in the power of prayer. It has a set prayer book which is taken from biblical sources, like the Book of Psalms, rabbinic sources.. and it essentially constitutes two parts. One being praise for God and the other being penitential prayer, which acknowledges the human dependency on God for our basic needs. Judaism specifically places the struggle for righteousness above perfection, to battle our nature, to be better. But it defines being better not first and foremost in terms of character improvement but in terms of societal improvement. 
In religious terms I would say that Judaism places world redemption above personal salvation. Like, whether you're going to heaven or hell is not a question that is emphasized, whether you contributed to feeding the hungry and clothing the naked and giving sight to the sightless is much more significant.

The Torah is the most important text, the five books of Moses. And then beyond that there's twenty-four books of the Bible. And then the rabbinical interpretations of those five books, which is called the Talmud. 
The message is that God gave ten commandments to the Jewish people, which are a code of ethical monotheism. God communicates with humans and imparts His will. In Judaism, membership in the faith is communicated either through birth to a Jewish mother or conversion to Judaism. But remember, Judaism is not just a religion; we are also a people, we're a nation. That's entry and participation in that people. 
My faith gives me a moral code by which to live. It teaches me how to have a set of values and priorities so that my life is not distracted by a lot of the noise of the modern world whose values may not be consistent with Judaism’s ancient values. It maximizes my potential by always inspiring me to be more. Judaism becomes my own voice of conscience that whispers in my ear constantly about right and wrong.

I don't believe in God, I know there is a God.""",0

Djime Said, 50, is the lone survivor of a Conservation Ranger massacre at Heban, Chad. Six Zakouma National Park rangers died in an attack by poachers who were members of the Sudanese military. A few weeks earlier, the Rangers found the poachers camp and took all their ammunition, their poached ivory and provisions. The poachers were out of camp at the time. These poachers then planned a counter-attack that began just before first light while the Rangers were sleeping. They would have woken to a hail of A.K rounds, the last sound they would ever hear. Djime Said was employed as a cook with the rangers in the rainy season. In his account, he said the pre-dawn night was very still when suddenly there was heavy firing out of nowhere. He found himself rolling down the steep hill that made up the Ranger post at Heban. He was shot but managed to hide away for the day and then come back to the camp that night where he confirmed that all the rangers were dead and the camp looted. He spent the next week trying to get help, two days of which were spent wading through a dense swamp on his way to aid. He received $2000 compensation from the Chadian government for his injuries but told me he no longer wanted to work for Zakouma after this experience. Since the time of the attack, the parks “Mamba” teams have greatly improved security, this coupled with better relations with the nomads in the region have developed an intelligence network that safeguards both the animals and the people trying to protect them. Every year many rangers die protecting a global heritage, they work for a pittance and endure conditions most humans would balk at. They do most of that with a smile on their faces. Surely we owe them more. #africaparks  #zakouma  #conservationrangers  #natgeo  #survivors",0

The Old Man of Storr, Isle of Skye, Scotland. As part of the Trotternish ridge - a 300m thick sandwich of around 24 layers of volcanic rock - the Storr was created by a massive ancient landslide, leaving one of the most iconic rock formations on the British Isles. The area in front of the cliffs is known as the Sanctuary, which has a number of weirdly shaped rock pinnacles created from the crumbling basalt.  Legend has it that the Old Man of Storr gets its name because the rock outline and the protruding pinnacle resemble that of the face of an old man. Storr means big in Norse.

Neist Point is the most Westerly point on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, and is regarded as the best place on Skye to see whales, dolphins, porpoises and basking shark. The area is renowned for its rock formations, which are closely akin to those at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. In fact, it is said that the causeway extends under the Irish sea from Northern Ireland to the Isle of Skye.

Michelle Hinkey: """"I grew up in a Christian home with my parents and five siblings. I attended schools run by the Bruderhof, which is a Christian communal movement. But believing in and following Christ is not something anyone else can do for me. I had to discover my own beliefs and faith. Unlike most Christian denominations, the Bruderhof doesn’t have consecrated church buildings. When the weather is nice, we often worship outdoors. In our community in Harlem, we have a rooftop deck, where we hold many of our worship meetings. As it says in Matthew 18:20 “For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them."" Jesus told his disciples that there are two great commandments. First: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. And secondly: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” My first task is to love and serve God, but my love to him is expressed through the love I show my neighbors. The best way for me to love God and my neighbors is by living in a Bruderhof community. For my community, the Sermon on the Mount is particularly important. In it, Jesus teaches us how to live a life of love, humility, service, purity, and forgiveness. Jesus also talks a lot about the Kingdom of God. Some people make this out just to be what’s beyond the grave. It’s not! It’s a blueprint, a model for how we ought to live. It is a kingdom of justice, of peace, of love. We can’t force it into being, but we can try our best to live it out in our own lives. 
I think every day I lose my faith and find it again. Sometimes it is hard to believe in a good God when I see all the suffering and problems in the world today, or even if I’m just having a bad day. But then I look around and see God’s work and beautiful creation in so many amazing and interconnected ways, people, friends, children, nature, trees, microorganisms. So I have to believe even if I don’t understand it all!""",0

Nocturnal behavior, startling screams, and mythology regarding some lemur species as holding the spirits of ancestors are thought to contribute to their ghostly name connection. The aye-aye is at the center of countless myths on the island of Madagascar, with many locals holding the belief that an encounter with the aye-aye brings great misfortune. Some Malagasy even believe that the aye-ayes are man-eaters, which is why you should never leave your village in the dark. In reality, the aye-aye leads a solitary life and is nocturnal, meaning an encounter with this unique lemur is rare.

She is the most influential member of the zoo’s zebra herd, with a dynamic personality and playful nature.

Have you ever wondered why zebras have stripes? There are five main hypotheses for what stripes do for this species. They are thought to: repel insects, provide camouflage through optical illusion, confuse predators, reduce body temperature, and help the animals recognize each other. Among the many theories, recent research found that zebras and certain blood-sucking insects inhabit the same places. Understanding how the stripe pattern impacts bug bites on this species may help researchers protect humans from disease-carrying insects! This species can digest taller, tougher grasses that other grazing animals have difficulty eating. As they migrate, they often move into new areas first. As they eat the high grasses, spurring more nutritious green plants to appear, allowing wildebeest and gazelles to roam in and eat. Some say zebras are white because the stripes end at their white belly. Others say black because when you shave the hair, the skin is mostly black.  What do you think?

Research scientist Dr. Isla Myers-Smith (University of Edinburgh) ascends the ridge in front of the glacier, the human scale in this austere yet beautiful landscape. Just decades ago, glacial ice would have covered the spot where Isla stands. As the ice retreats, vegetation and even animal remains are sometimes released from their frozen tombs, hundreds or even thousands of years after being locked away. While this disappearing ice is linked to global climate change, the specimens that emerge from the ice are invaluable to researchers. They act as windows (and even sources of DNA!) into the long past, cold deaths that gave an unexpected gift to science. Fortunately, researchers have been intensively studying this polar oasis for almost 40 years, making it one of the better understood patches of tundra in the Arctic and also a place where inconspicuous data like these are more likely to be spotted.  #AlexandraFiord  #Ellesmere  #HighArctic  #Canada  || Follow me @jtkerby for more on science and nature in harsh environments.",0

This is a critically endangered helmeted hornbill, found only in Sumatra and Borneo, with rare residence in the Malayan peninsula and southern Thailand. Unique to this hornbill species, the casque of this bird is solid ivory, and because of this they have been heavily poached in the ornamental trade. The hornbill’s casque, or “helmet”, allows them to pick up and manage food, helps to resonate sound when calling, and it has been suggested that the hornbill can also use the casque like a hammer.  Another threat to this species are native peoples in the Malaysian Peninsula, who hunt them due to the belief that their casques can protect them from evil spirits. The Penang Bird Park in Malaysia where this bird was photographed works to conserve this species and breed them in captivity. This bird is one of two helmeted hornbills at the park that were saved and donated by a local lumberjack who found the female and a her baby in the tree while he was working.  Knowing how rare this species was, he made sure to deliver the hornbills to Penang, where they have been carefully taken care of and kept healthy since their arrival. #Photoark  #helmetedhornbill  Follow @joelsartore to see a video of this hornbill!",1

Excited tourists observe a whale shark that has surfaced to eat a handful of krill from a guide in a small wooden outrigger near Oslo, in the Philippines. Each day hundreds of people journey to this small seaside village to watch and swim with these gentle filter feeding giants. Operations begin at 6 am and cease at 12:30 after which the whale sharks descend into the depths and the tourists melt away. The encounter begins with an orientation about whale sharks and a set of approach rules that include keeping 5 meters from head, no touching, chasing or blocking. Long lines of tourists form as they wait for a paddler to guide a small group through the offshore loop of boats for a 30 minute experience with the sharks. The practice of feeding (provisioning) the animals with handfuls of krill is highly controversial. Supporters maintain that the whale sharks have a historic presence here and can come and go; that the practice has broadly increased the local standard of living by providing employment to fisherman and decreasing the local fishing pressure; and that the sharks have become ocean ambassadors introducing thousands to marine life, increasing ocean awareness and hopefully stewardship. On the other hand, many conservation groups and scientists recognizes that this tourism may come at a cost to the whale sharks. Research suggests that feeding modifies their natural behavior through longer residency with an unknown impact of retained congregations on their local food resources, social structure, migration, reproduction and overall health. Whale sharks, once a heavily targeted fishery in the Philippines and Taiwan, are now protected in both countries and are endangered, but remain at risk of poaching and are actively fished in China and other countries for the lucrative shark fin trade. These giants are the world’s largest fish but much of their biology still remains a mystery as their populations decline around the planet. // From @natgeo assignment Philippines, An Ocean Nation // #WhaleSharkday  #Ocean  #Philippines  #Shark  #Ecotourism  #OceanConservation  #CoralTriangle  for #MoreOcean  follow @JenniferHayesig",1

One finally came and in May 2017 Katie received a new face in a 31-hour procedure. Throughout this process, her parents stood by her, learning everything they could about face transplants, medical procedures, medicines and numerous kinds of physical therapy. Their lives changed from being teachers to being ardent advocates for their child, accompanying her to daily visits with doctors and physical and speech therapists. They learned how to give her medications through a tube in leading to her stomach.

About 85% of this desert is made up of shifting sand dunes and recent atmospheric studies have shown that dust originating from the Taklamakan is blown over the Pacific and contributes to cloud formation over the Western United States. The Uyghur origin of the name ""Taklamakan"" is commonly interpreted as ""once you get in, you'll never get out""...

I was given a wonderful sculpture of a bull elephant. When my partner in life and work @ChristineEckstrom examined it closely, she realized it had been modeled after a photo I had made on assignment for @natgeo years ago of a famous elephant named ""Survivor"" in Zambia’s North Luangwa Valley. Survivor lived through a previous poaching holocaust in the 1980s and he was written up in Mark and Delia Owens' books ""Eye of the Elephant"" and ""Survivor’s Song."" The bull elephants depicted here, which I photographed in Botswana one memorable evening, lived more tranquil lives thanks to its government’s enlightened policy of putting a moratorium on elephant hunting, but even there the tide is turning. Nearly one hundred elephants were found poached in an area recently that had been a safe haven for years. I’m sharing this image in honor of all elephant champions including the late Paul Allen, and respectfully ask that you consider supporting the organizations that can turn the current poaching crisis around and secure a future for elephants.
